From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library



It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
make them their own.

Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings in
language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a mile
a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. These
expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource for
study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic texts
of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as Folger
Digital Texts, we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone who
wants them.

The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theater.

I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the Folger
either in-person or online, where a range of physical and digital
resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I commend
to you these words, and hope that they inspire.

                 Textual Introduction
          By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine


Until now, with the release of the Folger Digital Texts, readers in
search of a free online text of Shakespeare’s plays had to be content
primarily with using the Moby™ Text, which reproduces a late-
nineteenth century version of the plays. What is the difference? Many
ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what
Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare’s plays were not published the
way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single,
authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in
multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and
by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called
the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different
versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet,
and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and
then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the
other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more
accurate text.

Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar
word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or
whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into
Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred years of
printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural
preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created, for
example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda to
chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest,
1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
father, Prospero.

The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make
the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger
Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts
depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is
possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™, which hide
editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows
where the text has been altered because editorial interventions are
signaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: “ If she in
chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square brackets (for
example, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and fire to win your
right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet: “O farewell,
honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At any point in the text,
you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information.

Because the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first
century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger here
provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and
students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays
and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and
enjoyment of Shakespeare.
                              Synopsis


Events before the start of Hamlet set the stage for tragedy. When the
king of Denmark, Prince Hamlet’s father, suddenly dies, Hamlet’s
mother, Gertrude, marries his uncle Claudius, who becomes the new
king.

A spirit who claims to be the ghost of Hamlet’s father describes his
murder at the hands of Claudius and demands that Hamlet avenge the
killing. When the councilor Polonius learns from his daughter,
Ophelia, that Hamlet has visited her in an apparently distracted state,
Polonius attributes the prince’s condition to lovesickness, and he sets
a trap for Hamlet using Ophelia as bait.

To confirm Claudius’s guilt, Hamlet arranges for a play that mimics
the murder; Claudius’s reaction is that of a guilty man. Hamlet, now
free to act, mistakenly kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius.
Claudius sends Hamlet away as part of a deadly plot.

After Polonius’s death, Ophelia goes mad and later drowns. Hamlet,
who has returned safely to confront the king, agrees to a fencing
match with Ophelia’s brother, Laertes, who secretly poisons his own
rapier. At the match, Claudius prepares poisoned wine for Hamlet,
which Gertrude unknowingly drinks; as she dies, she accuses
Claudius, whom Hamlet kills. Then first Laertes and then Hamlet die,
both victims of Laertes’ rapier.

            BARNARDO
FTLN 0007     ’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
            FRANCISCO
FTLN 0008     For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold,
FTLN 0009     And I am sick at heart.
FTLN 0010   BARNARDO Have you had quiet guard?                      10
FTLN 0011   FRANCISCO Not a mouse stirring.
FTLN 0012   BARNARDO Well, good night.
FTLN 0013     If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
FTLN 0014     The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

                            Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

FTLN 0016   HORATIO Friends to this ground.

FTLN 0022   MARCELLUS Holla, Barnardo.
FTLN 0023   BARNARDO Say, what, is Horatio there?
FTLN 0024   HORATIO A piece of him.
            BARNARDO
FTLN 0025        Welcome, Horatio.—Welcome, good Marcellus.                      25
            HORATIO
FTLN 0026     What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
FTLN 0027   BARNARDO I have seen nothing.
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0028        Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy
FTLN 0029        And will not let belief take hold of him
FTLN 0030        Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.                   30
FTLN 0031        Therefore I have entreated him along
FTLN 0032        With us to watch the minutes of this night,
FTLN 0033        That, if again this apparition come,
FTLN 0034        He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0035        Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.                                  35
FTLN 0036   BARNARDO                          Sit down awhile,
FTLN 0037     And let us once again assail your ears,
FTLN 0038     That are so fortified against our story,
FTLN 0039     What we have two nights seen.
FTLN 0040   HORATIO                              Well, sit we down,              40
FTLN 0041     And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
FTLN 0042   BARNARDO Last night of all,
FTLN 0043     When yond same star that’s westward from the pole
FTLN 0044     Had made his course t’ illume that part of heaven
FTLN 0045     Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,                          45
FTLN 0046     The bell then beating one—
             11                        Hamlet                      ACT 1. SC. 1




                                      Enter Ghost.

            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0047     Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again.
            BARNARDO
FTLN 0048     In the same figure like the King that’s dead.
            MARCELLUS, to Horatio
FTLN 0049     Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.
            BARNARDO
FTLN 0050     Looks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.                       50
            HORATIO
FTLN 0051     Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
            BARNARDO
FTLN 0052     It would be spoke to.
FTLN 0053   MARCELLUS                  Speak to it, Horatio.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0054     What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,
FTLN 0055     Together with that fair and warlike form                            55
FTLN 0056     In which the majesty of buried Denmark
FTLN 0057     Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,
FTLN 0058       speak.
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0059     It is offended.
FTLN 0060   BARNARDO            See, it stalks away.                              60
            HORATIO
FTLN 0061     Stay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak!
                                                               Ghost exits.
FTLN 0062   MARCELLUS     ’Tis gone and will not answer.
            BARNARDO
FTLN 0063     How now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.
FTLN 0064     Is not this something more than fantasy?
FTLN 0065     What think you on ’t?                                               65
            HORATIO
FTLN 0066     Before my God, I might not this believe
FTLN 0067     Without the sensible and true avouch
FTLN 0068     Of mine own eyes.

FTLN 0069   MARCELLUS             Is it not like the King?
FTLN 0070   HORATIO As thou art to thyself.                                   70
FTLN 0071     Such was the very armor he had on
FTLN 0072     When he the ambitious Norway combated.
FTLN 0073     So frowned he once when, in an angry parle,
FTLN 0074     He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
FTLN 0075     ’Tis strange.                                                   75
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0076     Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
FTLN 0077     With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0078     In what particular thought to work I know not,
FTLN 0079     But in the gross and scope of mine opinion
FTLN 0080     This bodes some strange eruption to our state.                  80
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0081     Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
FTLN 0082     Why this same strict and most observant watch
FTLN 0083     So nightly toils the subject of the land,
FTLN 0084     And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
FTLN 0085     And foreign mart for implements of war,                         85
FTLN 0086     Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
FTLN 0087     Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
FTLN 0088     What might be toward that this sweaty haste
FTLN 0089     Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?
FTLN 0090     Who is ’t that can inform me?                                   90
FTLN 0091   HORATIO                              That can I.
FTLN 0092     At least the whisper goes so: our last king,
FTLN 0093     Whose image even but now appeared to us,
FTLN 0094     Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
FTLN 0095     Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,                     95
FTLN 0096     Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
FTLN 0097     (For so this side of our known world esteemed him)
FTLN 0098     Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,
FTLN 0099     Well ratified by law and heraldry,
FTLN 0100     Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands                 100
FTLN 0101     Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.

FTLN 0102     Against the which a moiety competent
FTLN 0103     Was gagèd by our king, which had returned
FTLN 0104     To the inheritance of Fortinbras
FTLN 0105     Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart                     105
FTLN 0106     And carriage of the article designed,

FTLN 0108     Of unimprovèd mettle hot and full,
FTLN 0109     Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
FTLN 0110     Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes                             110
FTLN 0111     For food and diet to some enterprise
FTLN 0112     That hath a stomach in ’t; which is no other
FTLN 0113     (As it doth well appear unto our state)
FTLN 0114     But to recover of us, by strong hand
FTLN 0115     And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands                       115
FTLN 0116     So by his father lost. And this, I take it,
FTLN 0117     Is the main motive of our preparations,
FTLN 0118     The source of this our watch, and the chief head
FTLN 0119     Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.
            BARNARDO
FTLN 0120     I think it be no other but e’en so.                                120
FTLN 0121     Well may it sort that this portentous figure
FTLN 0122     Comes armèd through our watch so like the king
FTLN 0123     That was and is the question of these wars.

FTLN 0124     A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.
FTLN 0125     In the most high and palmy state of Rome,                          125
FTLN 0126     A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
FTLN 0127     The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
FTLN 0128     Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
FTLN 0129     As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,

FTLN 0140     If thou hast any sound or use of voice,                              140
FTLN 0141     Speak to me.
FTLN 0142     If there be any good thing to be done
FTLN 0143     That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
FTLN 0144     Speak to me.
FTLN 0145     If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,                             145
FTLN 0146     Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
FTLN 0147     O, speak!
FTLN 0148     Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
FTLN 0149     Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
FTLN 0150     For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,                  150
FTLN 0151     Speak of it.                                  The cock crows.
FTLN 0152                     Stay and speak!—Stop it, Marcellus.
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0153     Shall I strike it with my partisan?
FTLN 0154   HORATIO Do, if it will not stand.
FTLN 0155   BARNARDO ’Tis here.                                                    155
FTLN 0156   HORATIO ’Tis here.
                                                              Ghost exits.
FTLN 0157   MARCELLUS       ’Tis gone.
FTLN 0158     We do it wrong, being so majestical,
FTLN 0159     To offer it the show of violence,
FTLN 0160     For it is as the air, invulnerable,                                  160
FTLN 0161     And our vain blows malicious mockery.
            BARNARDO
FTLN 0162     It was about to speak when the cock crew.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0163     And then it started like a guilty thing
FTLN 0164     Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
             19                      Hamlet                       ACT 1. SC. 1




FTLN 0165     The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,                         165
FTLN 0166     Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
FTLN 0167     Awake the god of day, and at his warning,
FTLN 0168     Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
FTLN 0169     Th’ extravagant and erring spirit hies
FTLN 0170     To his confine, and of the truth herein                            170
FTLN 0171     This present object made probation.
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0172     It faded on the crowing of the cock.
FTLN 0173     Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes
FTLN 0174     Wherein our Savior’s birth is celebrated,
FTLN 0175     This bird of dawning singeth all night long;                       175
FTLN 0176     And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
FTLN 0177     The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
FTLN 0178     No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
FTLN 0179     So hallowed and so gracious is that time.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0180     So have I heard and do in part believe it.                         180
FTLN 0181     But look, the morn in russet mantle clad
FTLN 0182     Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
FTLN 0183     Break we our watch up, and by my advice
FTLN 0184     Let us impart what we have seen tonight
FTLN 0185     Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,                              185
FTLN 0186     This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
FTLN 0187     Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
FTLN 0188     As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0189     Let’s do ’t, I pray, and I this morning know
FTLN 0190     Where we shall find him most convenient.                           190
                                                               They exit.

                                      Scene 2
              Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the
               Queen, the Council, as Polonius, and his son Laertes,
                 Hamlet, with others, among them Voltemand and
                                    Cornelius.

            KING
FTLN 0191     Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death
FTLN 0192     The memory be green, and that it us befitted
FTLN 0193     To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
FTLN 0194     To be contracted in one brow of woe,
FTLN 0195     Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature                       5
FTLN 0196     That we with wisest sorrow think on him
FTLN 0197     Together with remembrance of ourselves.
FTLN 0198     Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
FTLN 0199     Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,
FTLN 0200     Have we (as ’twere with a defeated joy,                             10
FTLN 0201     With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
FTLN 0202     With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
FTLN 0203     In equal scale weighing delight and dole)
FTLN 0204     Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred
FTLN 0205     Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone                         15
FTLN 0206     With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
FTLN 0207     Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,
FTLN 0208     Holding a weak supposal of our worth
FTLN 0209     Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death
FTLN 0210     Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,                          20
FTLN 0211     Colleaguèd with this dream of his advantage,
FTLN 0212     He hath not failed to pester us with message
FTLN 0213     Importing the surrender of those lands
FTLN 0214     Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
FTLN 0215     To our most valiant brother—so much for him.                        25
FTLN 0216     Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
FTLN 0217     Thus much the business is: we have here writ
FTLN 0218     To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
FTLN 0219     Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
             23                       Hamlet                       ACT 1. SC. 2




FTLN 0220     Of this his nephew’s purpose, to suppress                           30
FTLN 0221     His further gait herein, in that the levies,
FTLN 0222     The lists, and full proportions are all made
FTLN 0223     Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
FTLN 0224     You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
FTLN 0225     For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,                         35
FTLN 0226     Giving to you no further personal power
FTLN 0227     To business with the King more than the scope
FTLN 0228     Of these dilated articles allow.
                                                      Giving them a paper.
FTLN 0229     Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
            CORNELIUS/VOLTEMAND
FTLN 0230     In that and all things will we show our duty.                       40
            KING
FTLN 0231     We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                           Voltemand and Cornelius exit.
FTLN 0232     And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?
FTLN 0233     You told us of some suit. What is ’t, Laertes?
FTLN 0234     You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
FTLN 0235     And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,                         45
FTLN 0236       Laertes,
FTLN 0237     That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
FTLN 0238     The head is not more native to the heart,
FTLN 0239     The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
FTLN 0240     Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.                        50
FTLN 0241     What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
FTLN 0242   LAERTES                                 My dread lord,
FTLN 0243     Your leave and favor to return to France,
FTLN 0244     From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
FTLN 0245     To show my duty in your coronation,                                 55
FTLN 0246     Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
FTLN 0247     My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
FTLN 0248     And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
            KING
FTLN 0249     Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?
             25                      Hamlet                        ACT 1. SC. 2




            POLONIUS
FTLN 0250     Hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave                          60
FTLN 0251     By laborsome petition, and at last
FTLN 0252     Upon his will I sealed my hard consent.
FTLN 0253     I do beseech you give him leave to go.
            KING
FTLN 0254     Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
FTLN 0255     And thy best graces spend it at thy will.—                          65
FTLN 0256     But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son—
            HAMLET , aside
FTLN 0257     A little more than kin and less than kind.
            KING
FTLN 0258     How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
            HAMLET
FTLN 0259     Not so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.
            QUEEN
FTLN 0260     Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,                            70
FTLN 0261     And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
FTLN 0262     Do not forever with thy vailèd lids
FTLN 0263     Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
FTLN 0264     Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die,
FTLN 0265     Passing through nature to eternity.                                 75
            HAMLET
FTLN 0266     Ay, madam, it is common.
FTLN 0267   QUEEN                         If it be,
FTLN 0268     Why seems it so particular with thee?
            HAMLET
FTLN 0269     “Seems,” madam? Nay, it is. I know not “seems.”
FTLN 0270     ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,                          80
FTLN 0271     Nor customary suits of solemn black,
FTLN 0272     Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
FTLN 0273     No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
FTLN 0274     Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
FTLN 0275     Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,                    85
FTLN 0276     That can denote me truly. These indeed “seem,”
FTLN 0277     For they are actions that a man might play;
             27                       Hamlet                       ACT 1. SC. 2




FTLN 0278     But I have that within which passes show,
FTLN 0279     These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
            KING
FTLN 0280     ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,                          90
FTLN 0281        Hamlet,
FTLN 0282     To give these mourning duties to your father.
FTLN 0283     But you must know your father lost a father,
FTLN 0284     That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
FTLN 0285     In filial obligation for some term                                  95
FTLN 0286     To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
FTLN 0287     In obstinate condolement is a course
FTLN 0288     Of impious stubbornness. ’Tis unmanly grief.
FTLN 0289     It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
FTLN 0290     A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,                              100
FTLN 0291     An understanding simple and unschooled.
FTLN 0292     For what we know must be and is as common
FTLN 0293     As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
FTLN 0294     Why should we in our peevish opposition
FTLN 0295     Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,                      105
FTLN 0296     A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
FTLN 0297     To reason most absurd, whose common theme
FTLN 0298     Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
FTLN 0299     From the first corse till he that died today,
FTLN 0300     “This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth                      110
FTLN 0301     This unprevailing woe and think of us
FTLN 0302     As of a father; for let the world take note,
FTLN 0303     You are the most immediate to our throne,
FTLN 0304     And with no less nobility of love
FTLN 0305     Than that which dearest father bears his son                        115
FTLN 0306     Do I impart toward you. For your intent
FTLN 0307     In going back to school in Wittenberg,
FTLN 0308     It is most retrograde to our desire,
FTLN 0309     And we beseech you, bend you to remain
FTLN 0310     Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,                           120
FTLN 0311     Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

            QUEEN
FTLN 0312     Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
FTLN 0313     I pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0314     I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
            KING
FTLN 0315     Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.                                125
FTLN 0316     Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come.
FTLN 0317     This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
FTLN 0318     Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof
FTLN 0319     No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
FTLN 0320     But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,                      130
FTLN 0321     And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,

            HAMLET
FTLN 0323     O, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,
FTLN 0324     Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew,
FTLN 0325     Or that the Everlasting had not fixed                               135
FTLN 0326     His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,
FTLN 0327     How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
FTLN 0328     Seem to me all the uses of this world!
FTLN 0329     Fie on ’t, ah fie! ’Tis an unweeded garden
FTLN 0330     That grows to seed. Things rank and gross in nature                 140
FTLN 0331     Possess it merely. That it should come to this:
FTLN 0332     But two months dead—nay, not so much, not two.
FTLN 0333     So excellent a king, that was to this
FTLN 0334     Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
FTLN 0335     That he might not beteem the winds of heaven                        145
FTLN 0336     Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and Earth,
FTLN 0337     Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
FTLN 0338     As if increase of appetite had grown
FTLN 0339     By what it fed on. And yet, within a month
FTLN 0340     (Let me not think on ’t; frailty, thy name is woman!),              150
FTLN 0341     A little month, or ere those shoes were old
FTLN 0342     With which she followed my poor father’s body,

FTLN 0343     Like Niobe, all tears—why she, even she
FTLN 0344     (O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason
FTLN 0345     Would have mourned longer!), married with my                      155
FTLN 0346        uncle,
FTLN 0347     My father’s brother, but no more like my father
FTLN 0348     Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
FTLN 0349     Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
FTLN 0350     Had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes,                         160
FTLN 0351     She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
FTLN 0352     With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
FTLN 0353     It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
FTLN 0354     But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.

FTLN 0355   HORATIO  Hail to your Lordship.                                     165
FTLN 0356   HAMLET I am glad to see you well.
FTLN 0357     Horatio—or I do forget myself!
            HORATIO
FTLN 0358     The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0359     Sir, my good friend. I’ll change that name with you.
FTLN 0360     And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—                      170
FTLN 0361     Marcellus?
FTLN 0362   MARCELLUS My good lord.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0363     I am very glad to see you. To Barnardo. Good
FTLN 0364        even, sir.—
FTLN 0365     But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?                     175
            HORATIO
FTLN 0366     A truant disposition, good my lord.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0367     I would not hear your enemy say so,
FTLN 0368     Nor shall you do my ear that violence
FTLN 0369     To make it truster of your own report
FTLN 0370     Against yourself. I know you are no truant.                       180
FTLN 0371     But what is your affair in Elsinore?
FTLN 0372     We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
             33                       Hamlet                          ACT 1. SC. 2




            HORATIO
FTLN 0373     My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0374     I prithee, do not mock me, fellow student.
FTLN 0375     I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.                             185
            HORATIO
FTLN 0376     Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0377     Thrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats
FTLN 0378     Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
FTLN 0379     Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
FTLN 0380     Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!                                  190
FTLN 0381     My father—methinks I see my father.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0382     Where, my lord?
FTLN 0383   HAMLET                In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0384     I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0385     He was a man. Take him for all in all,                                 195
FTLN 0386     I shall not look upon his like again.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0387     My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
FTLN 0388   HAMLET Saw who?
            HORATIO
FTLN 0389     My lord, the King your father.
FTLN 0390   HAMLET                              The King my father?                  200
            HORATIO
FTLN 0391     Season your admiration for a while
FTLN 0392     With an attent ear, till I may deliver
FTLN 0393     Upon the witness of these gentlemen
FTLN 0394     This marvel to you.
FTLN 0395   HAMLET                     For God’s love, let me hear!                  205
            HORATIO
FTLN 0396     Two nights together had these gentlemen,
FTLN 0397     Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,
             35                       Hamlet                         ACT 1. SC. 2




FTLN 0398     In the dead waste and middle of the night,
FTLN 0399     Been thus encountered: a figure like your father,
FTLN 0400     Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,                                    210
FTLN 0401     Appears before them and with solemn march
FTLN 0402     Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked
FTLN 0403     By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes
FTLN 0404     Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled
FTLN 0405     Almost to jelly with the act of fear,                                 215
FTLN 0406     Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
FTLN 0407     In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
FTLN 0408     And I with them the third night kept the watch,
FTLN 0409      Where, as they had delivered, both in time,
FTLN 0410     Form of the thing (each word made true and good),                     220
FTLN 0411     The apparition comes. I knew your father;
FTLN 0412     These hands are not more like.
FTLN 0413   HAMLET                               But where was this?
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0414     My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0415     Did you not speak to it?                                              225
FTLN 0416   HORATIO                        My lord, I did,
FTLN 0417     But answer made it none. Yet once methought
FTLN 0418     It lifted up its head and did address
FTLN 0419     Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
FTLN 0420     But even then the morning cock crew loud,                             230
FTLN 0421     And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
FTLN 0422     And vanished from our sight.
FTLN 0423   HAMLET                              ’Tis very strange.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0424     As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.
FTLN 0425     And we did think it writ down in our duty                             235
FTLN 0426     To let you know of it.
FTLN 0427   HAMLET Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
FTLN 0428     Hold you the watch tonight?
FTLN 0429   ALL                              We do, my lord.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0430     Armed, say you?                                                       240
             37                         Hamlet                       ACT 1. SC. 2




FTLN 0431   ALL                     Armed, my lord.
FTLN 0432   HAMLET                                      From top to toe?
FTLN 0433   ALL  My lord, from head to foot.
FTLN 0434   HAMLET Then saw you not his face?
            HORATIO
FTLN 0435     O, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.                               245
FTLN 0436   HAMLET What, looked he frowningly?
            HORATIO
FTLN 0437     A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
FTLN 0438   HAMLET Pale or red?
            HORATIO
FTLN 0439      Nay, very pale.
FTLN 0440   HAMLET                And fixed his eyes upon you?                      250
            HORATIO
FTLN 0441      Most constantly.
FTLN 0442   HAMLET                 I would I had been there.
FTLN 0443   HORATIO    It would have much amazed you.
FTLN 0444   HAMLET     Very like. Stayed it long?
            HORATIO
FTLN 0445     While one with moderate haste might tell a                            255
FTLN 0446       hundred.
FTLN 0447   BARNARDO/MARCELLUS Longer, longer.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0448      Not when I saw ’t.
FTLN 0449   HAMLET                   His beard was grizzled, no?
            HORATIO
FTLN 0450     It was as I have seen it in his life,                                 260
FTLN 0451     A sable silvered.
FTLN 0452   HAMLET                I will watch tonight.
FTLN 0453     Perchance ’twill walk again.
FTLN 0454   HORATIO                             I warrant it will.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0455      If it assume my noble father’s person,                               265
FTLN 0456      I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
FTLN 0457      And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
FTLN 0458      If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
             39                       Hamlet                        ACT 1. SC. 3




FTLN 0459     Let it be tenable in your silence still;
FTLN 0460     And whatsomever else shall hap tonight,                              270
FTLN 0461     Give it an understanding but no tongue.
FTLN 0462     I will requite your loves. So fare you well.
FTLN 0463     Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,
FTLN 0464     I’ll visit you.
FTLN 0465   ALL               Our duty to your Honor.                              275
            HAMLET
FTLN 0466     Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                                      All but Hamlet exit.
FTLN 0467     My father’s spirit—in arms! All is not well.
FTLN 0468     I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
FTLN 0469     Till then, sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
FTLN 0470     Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s                        280
FTLN 0471        eyes.
                                                                   He exits.

                        Enter Laertes and Ophelia, his sister.

            LAERTES
FTLN 0472     My necessaries are embarked. Farewell.
FTLN 0473     And, sister, as the winds give benefit
FTLN 0474     And convey is assistant, do not sleep,
FTLN 0475     But let me hear from you.
FTLN 0476   OPHELIA                        Do you doubt that?                      5
            LAERTES
FTLN 0477     For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,
FTLN 0478     Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
FTLN 0479     A violet in the youth of primy nature,
FTLN 0480     Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
FTLN 0481     The perfume and suppliance of a minute,                              10
FTLN 0482     No more.
FTLN 0483   OPHELIA        No more but so?
FTLN 0484   LAERTES                          Think it no more.
             41                       Hamlet                      ACT 1. SC. 3




FTLN 0485     For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
FTLN 0486     In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,                      15
FTLN 0487     The inward service of the mind and soul
FTLN 0488     Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
FTLN 0489     And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
FTLN 0490     The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
FTLN 0491     His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,                    20
FTLN 0492      For he himself is subject to his birth.
FTLN 0493     He may not, as unvalued persons do,
FTLN 0494     Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
FTLN 0495     The safety and the health of this whole state.
FTLN 0496     And therefore must his choice be circumscribed                     25
FTLN 0497     Unto the voice and yielding of that body
FTLN 0498     Whereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves
FTLN 0499        you,
FTLN 0500     It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
FTLN 0501     As he in his particular act and place                              30
FTLN 0502     May give his saying deed, which is no further
FTLN 0503     Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
FTLN 0504     Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain
FTLN 0505     If with too credent ear you list his songs
FTLN 0506     Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open                    35
FTLN 0507     To his unmastered importunity.
FTLN 0508     Fear it, Ophelia; fear it, my dear sister,
FTLN 0509     And keep you in the rear of your affection,
FTLN 0510     Out of the shot and danger of desire.
FTLN 0511     The chariest maid is prodigal enough                               40
FTLN 0512     If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
FTLN 0513     Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes.
FTLN 0514     The canker galls the infants of the spring
FTLN 0515     Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
FTLN 0516     And, in the morn and liquid dew of youth,                          45
FTLN 0517     Contagious blastments are most imminent.
FTLN 0518     Be wary, then; best safety lies in fear.
FTLN 0519     Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
            OPHELIA
FTLN 0520     I shall the effect of this good lesson keep
             43                      Hamlet                    ACT 1. SC. 3




FTLN 0521     As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,                  50
FTLN 0522     Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
FTLN 0523     Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
FTLN 0524     Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,
FTLN 0525     Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
FTLN 0526     And recks not his own rede.                                     55
FTLN 0527   LAERTES                         O, fear me not.

                                  Enter Polonius.

FTLN 0528     I stay too long. But here my father comes.
FTLN 0529     A double blessing is a double grace.
FTLN 0530     Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0531     Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!                   60
FTLN 0532     The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
FTLN 0533     And you are stayed for. There, my blessing with
FTLN 0534       thee.
FTLN 0535     And these few precepts in thy memory
FTLN 0536     Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,               65
FTLN 0537     Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
FTLN 0538     Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
FTLN 0539     Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
FTLN 0540     Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,
FTLN 0541     But do not dull thy palm with entertainment                     70
FTLN 0542     Of each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware
FTLN 0543     Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,
FTLN 0544     Bear ’t that th’ opposèd may beware of thee.
FTLN 0545     Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.
FTLN 0546     Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.              75
FTLN 0547     Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
FTLN 0548     But not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),
FTLN 0549     For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
FTLN 0550     And they in France of the best rank and station
FTLN 0551      Are of a most select and generous chief in that.               80
FTLN 0552     Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
FTLN 0553     For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
             45                      Hamlet                         ACT 1. SC. 3




FTLN 0554     And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
FTLN 0555     This above all: to thine own self be true,
FTLN 0556     And it must follow, as the night the day,                            85
FTLN 0557     Thou canst not then be false to any man.
FTLN 0558     Farewell. My blessing season this in thee.
            LAERTES
FTLN 0559     Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0560     The time invests you. Go, your servants tend.
            LAERTES
FTLN 0561     Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well                                 90
FTLN 0562     What I have said to you.
FTLN 0563   OPHELIA ’Tis in my memory locked,
FTLN 0564     And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
FTLN 0565   LAERTES Farewell.                                 Laertes exits.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0566     What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?                            95
            OPHELIA
FTLN 0567     So please you, something touching the Lord
FTLN 0568        Hamlet.
FTLN 0569   POLONIUS Marry, well bethought.
FTLN 0570     ’Tis told me he hath very oft of late
FTLN 0571     Given private time to you, and you yourself                          100
FTLN 0572     Have of your audience been most free and
FTLN 0573        bounteous.
FTLN 0574     If it be so (as so ’tis put on me,
FTLN 0575     And that in way of caution), I must tell you
FTLN 0576     You do not understand yourself so clearly                            105
FTLN 0577     As it behooves my daughter and your honor.
FTLN 0578     What is between you? Give me up the truth.
            OPHELIA
FTLN 0579     He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
FTLN 0580     Of his affection to me.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0581     Affection, puh! You speak like a green girl                          110
FTLN 0582     Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
FTLN 0583     Do you believe his “tenders,” as you call them?
             47                      Hamlet                       ACT 1. SC. 3




            OPHELIA
FTLN 0584     I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0585     Marry, I will teach you. Think yourself a baby
FTLN 0586     That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,                    115
FTLN 0587     Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
FTLN 0588     Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
FTLN 0589      Running it thus) you’ll tender me a fool.
            OPHELIA
FTLN 0590     My lord, he hath importuned me with love
FTLN 0591     In honorable fashion—                                              120
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0592     Ay, “fashion” you may call it. Go to, go to!
            OPHELIA
FTLN 0593     And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
FTLN 0594     With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0595     Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
FTLN 0596     When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul                        125
FTLN 0597     Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
FTLN 0598     Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
FTLN 0599     Even in their promise as it is a-making,
FTLN 0600     You must not take for fire. From this time
FTLN 0601     Be something scanter of your maiden presence.                      130
FTLN 0602     Set your entreatments at a higher rate
FTLN 0603     Than a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,
FTLN 0604     Believe so much in him that he is young,
FTLN 0605     And with a larger tether may he walk
FTLN 0606     Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,                            135
FTLN 0607     Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,
FTLN 0608     Not of that dye which their investments show,
FTLN 0609     But mere implorators of unholy suits,
FTLN 0610     Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
FTLN 0611     The better to beguile. This is for all:                            140
FTLN 0612     I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
FTLN 0613     Have you so slander any moment leisure

FTLN 0614     As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
FTLN 0615     Look to ’t, I charge you. Come your ways.
FTLN 0616   OPHELIA I shall obey, my lord.                                       145
                                                                They exit.


                                     Scene 4
                       Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

            HAMLET
FTLN 0617     The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0618     It is a nipping and an eager air.
FTLN 0619   HAMLET What hour now?
FTLN 0620   HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve.
FTLN 0621   MARCELLUS No, it is struck.                                          5
            HORATIO
FTLN 0622     Indeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the season
FTLN 0623     Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                           A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off.
FTLN 0624     What does this mean, my lord?
            HAMLET
FTLN 0625     The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,
FTLN 0626     Keeps wassail, and the swagg’ring upspring reels;                  10
FTLN 0627     And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
FTLN 0628     The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
FTLN 0629     The triumph of his pledge.
FTLN 0630   HORATIO Is it a custom?
FTLN 0631   HAMLET Ay, marry, is ’t,                                             15
FTLN 0632     But, to my mind, though I am native here
FTLN 0633     And to the manner born, it is a custom
FTLN 0634     More honored in the breach than the observance.
FTLN 0635      This heavy-headed revel east and west
FTLN 0636     Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.                      20
FTLN 0637     They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
FTLN 0638     Soil our addition. And, indeed, it takes
             51                       Hamlet                        ACT 1. SC. 4




FTLN 0639     From our achievements, though performed at
FTLN 0640       height,
FTLN 0641     The pith and marrow of our attribute.                                25
FTLN 0642     So oft it chances in particular men
FTLN 0643     That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
FTLN 0644     As in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,
FTLN 0645     Since nature cannot choose his origin),
FTLN 0646     By the o’ergrowth of some complexion                                 30
FTLN 0647     (Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason),
FTLN 0648     Or by some habit that too much o’erleavens
FTLN 0649     The form of plausive manners—that these men,
FTLN 0650     Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
FTLN 0651     Being nature’s livery or fortune’s star,                             35
FTLN 0652     His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,
FTLN 0653     As infinite as man may undergo,
FTLN 0654     Shall in the general censure take corruption
FTLN 0655     From that particular fault. The dram of evil
FTLN 0656     Doth all the noble substance of a doubt                              40
FTLN 0657     To his own scandal.

                                     Enter Ghost.

FTLN 0658   HORATIO                   Look, my lord, it comes.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0659     Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!
FTLN 0660     Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,
FTLN 0661     Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from                      45
FTLN 0662       hell,
FTLN 0663     Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
FTLN 0664     Thou com’st in such a questionable shape
FTLN 0665     That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee “Hamlet,”
FTLN 0666     “King,” “Father,” “Royal Dane.” O, answer me!                        50
FTLN 0667     Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
FTLN 0668     Why thy canonized bones, hearsèd in death,
FTLN 0669     Have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,
FTLN 0670     Wherein we saw thee quietly interred,
FTLN 0671     Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws                              55
             53                       Hamlet                      ACT 1. SC. 4




FTLN 0672     To cast thee up again. What may this mean
FTLN 0673     That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
FTLN 0674     Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
FTLN 0675     Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
FTLN 0676     So horridly to shake our disposition                               60
FTLN 0677     With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
FTLN 0678     Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?
                                                         Ghost beckons.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0679     It beckons you to go away with it
FTLN 0680     As if it some impartment did desire
FTLN 0681     To you alone.                                                      65
FTLN 0682   MARCELLUS         Look with what courteous action
FTLN 0683     It waves you to a more removèd ground.
FTLN 0684     But do not go with it.
FTLN 0685   HORATIO                  No, by no means.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0686     It will not speak. Then I will follow it.                          70
            HORATIO
FTLN 0687     Do not, my lord.
FTLN 0688   HAMLET                Why, what should be the fear?
FTLN 0689     I do not set my life at a pin’s fee.
FTLN 0690     And for my soul, what can it do to that,
FTLN 0691     Being a thing immortal as itself?                                  75
FTLN 0692     It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0693     What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord?
FTLN 0694     Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
FTLN 0695     That beetles o’er his base into the sea,
FTLN 0696     And there assume some other horrible form                          80
FTLN 0697     Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
FTLN 0698     And draw you into madness? Think of it.
FTLN 0699      The very place puts toys of desperation,
FTLN 0700     Without more motive, into every brain
FTLN 0701     That looks so many fathoms to the sea                              85
FTLN 0702     And hears it roar beneath.

            HAMLET
FTLN 0703     It waves me still.—Go on, I’ll follow thee.
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0704     You shall not go, my lord.        They hold back Hamlet.
FTLN 0705   HAMLET                          Hold off your hands.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0706     Be ruled. You shall not go.                                        90
FTLN 0707   HAMLET                         My fate cries out
FTLN 0708     And makes each petty arture in this body
FTLN 0709     As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.
FTLN 0710     Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.
FTLN 0711     By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!                  95
FTLN 0712     I say, away!—Go on. I’ll follow thee.
                                                  Ghost and Hamlet exit.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0713     He waxes desperate with imagination.
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0714     Let’s follow. ’Tis not fit thus to obey him.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0715     Have after. To what issue will this come?
            MARCELLUS
FTLN 0716     Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.                       100

FTLN 0717     Heaven will direct it.
FTLN 0718   MARCELLUS                  Nay, let’s follow him.

FTLN 0735     Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
FTLN 0736     Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
FTLN 0737     To tell the secrets of my prison house,
FTLN 0738     I could a tale unfold whose lightest word                          20
FTLN 0739     Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,

FTLN 0779     Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
FTLN 0780     So, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,
FTLN 0781     Will sate itself in a celestial bed
FTLN 0782     And prey on garbage.
FTLN 0783     But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.                          65
FTLN 0784     Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
FTLN 0785     My custom always of the afternoon,
FTLN 0786     Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
FTLN 0787     With juice of cursèd hebona in a vial
FTLN 0788     And in the porches of my ears did pour                               70
             61                      Hamlet                       ACT 1. SC. 5




FTLN 0789     The leprous distilment, whose effect
FTLN 0790     Holds such an enmity with blood of man
FTLN 0791     That swift as quicksilver it courses through
FTLN 0792     The natural gates and alleys of the body,
FTLN 0793     And with a sudden vigor it doth posset                             75
FTLN 0794     And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
FTLN 0795     The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,
FTLN 0796     And a most instant tetter barked about,
FTLN 0797     Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
FTLN 0798     All my smooth body.                                                80
FTLN 0799     Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand
FTLN 0800     Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,
FTLN 0801     Cut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,
FTLN 0802     Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,
FTLN 0803     No reck’ning made, but sent to my account                          85
FTLN 0804     With all my imperfections on my head.
FTLN 0805     O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!
FTLN 0806     If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
FTLN 0807     Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
FTLN 0808     A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.                              90
FTLN 0809     But, howsomever thou pursues this act,
FTLN 0810     Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
FTLN 0811     Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven
FTLN 0812     And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
FTLN 0813     To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.                    95
FTLN 0814     The glowworm shows the matin to be near
FTLN 0815     And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
FTLN 0816     Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.               He exits.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0817     O all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?
FTLN 0818     And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,              100
FTLN 0819     And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
FTLN 0820     But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
FTLN 0821     Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat
FTLN 0822     In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
FTLN 0823     Yea, from the table of my memory                                   105

FTLN 0824     I’ll wipe away all trivial, fond records,
FTLN 0825     All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
FTLN 0826     That youth and observation copied there,
FTLN 0827     And thy commandment all alone shall live

FTLN 0829     Unmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!

FTLN 0833     That one may smile and smile and be a villain.                        115
FTLN 0834     At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.

FTLN 0835     So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.
FTLN 0836     It is “adieu, adieu, remember me.”
FTLN 0837     I have sworn ’t.

FTLN 0845   HORATIO                        What news, my lord?
FTLN 0846   HAMLET    O, wonderful!
            HORATIO
FTLN 0847     Good my lord, tell it.
FTLN 0848   HAMLET                     No, you will reveal it.                      130

FTLN 0852      it?
FTLN 0853     But you’ll be secret?                                                 135

FTLN 0854   HORATIO/MARCELLUS        Ay, by heaven, my lord.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0855     There’s never a villain dwelling in all Denmark
FTLN 0856     But he’s an arrant knave.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0857     There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
FTLN 0858     To tell us this.                                                    140
FTLN 0859   HAMLET               Why, right, you are in the right.
FTLN 0860     And so, without more circumstance at all,
FTLN 0861     I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,
FTLN 0862     You, as your business and desire shall point you
FTLN 0863     (For every man hath business and desire,                            145
FTLN 0864     Such as it is), and for my own poor part,
FTLN 0865     I will go pray.
            HORATIO
FTLN 0866     These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0867     I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
FTLN 0868     Yes, faith, heartily.                                               150
FTLN 0869   HORATIO                 There’s no offense, my lord.
            HAMLET
FTLN 0870     Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
FTLN 0871     And much offense, too. Touching this vision here,
FTLN 0872     It is an honest ghost—that let me tell you.
FTLN 0873     For your desire to know what is between us,                         155
FTLN 0874     O’ermaster ’t as you may. And now, good friends,
FTLN 0875     As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
FTLN 0876     Give me one poor request.
FTLN 0877   HORATIO What is ’t, my lord? We will.

FTLN 0878     Never make known what you have seen tonight.                        160
FTLN 0879   HORATIO/MARCELLUS    My lord, we will not.
FTLN 0880   HAMLET Nay, but swear ’t.

FTLN 0889     Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.
FTLN 0890     Consent to swear.
FTLN 0891   HORATIO                Propose the oath, my lord.
            HAMLET

FTLN 0893     Swear by my sword.                                                175

FTLN 0901     Well said, old mole. Canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?—
FTLN 0902     A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.

FTLN 0910     To put an antic disposition on)

            POLONIUS
FTLN 0931     Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
FTLN 0932   REYNALDO I will, my lord.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0933     You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo,
FTLN 0934     Before you visit him, to make inquire
FTLN 0935     Of his behavior.                                      5
FTLN 0936   REYNALDO            My lord, I did intend it.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0937     Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
FTLN 0938     Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
FTLN 0939     And how, and who, what means, and where they
FTLN 0940       keep,                                               10
FTLN 0941     What company, at what expense; and finding
FTLN 0942     By this encompassment and drift of question
FTLN 0943     That they do know my son, come you more nearer
FTLN 0944     Than your particular demands will touch it.
FTLN 0945     Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him,   15
FTLN 0946     As thus: “I know his father and his friends

FTLN 0952     What forgeries you please—marry, none so rank
FTLN 0953     As may dishonor him, take heed of that,

FTLN 0957   REYNALDO                  As gaming, my lord.

FTLN 0959     Quarreling, drabbing—you may go so far.

            POLONIUS
FTLN 0961     Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
FTLN 0962     You must not put another scandal on him
FTLN 0963     That he is open to incontinency;
FTLN 0964     That’s not my meaning. But breathe his faults so

FTLN 0969     Of general assault.

FTLN 0971   POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this?
FTLN 0972   REYNALDO Ay, my lord, I would know that.
FTLN 0973   POLONIUS Marry, sir, here’s my drift,
FTLN 0974     And I believe it is a fetch of wit.

FTLN 0990       or so,” and “gentleman.”                                          60
            POLONIUS
FTLN 0991     At “closes in the consequence”—ay, marry—
FTLN 0992     He closes thus: “I know the gentleman.
FTLN 0993     I saw him yesterday,” or “th’ other day”
FTLN 0994     (Or then, or then, with such or such), “and as you
FTLN 0995        say,                                                             65
FTLN 0996     There was he gaming, there o’ertook in ’s rouse,
FTLN 0997     There falling out at tennis”; or perchance
FTLN 0998     “I saw him enter such a house of sale”—
FTLN 0999     Videlicet, a brothel—or so forth. See you now
FTLN 1000     Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth;                     70
FTLN 1001     And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
FTLN 1002     With windlasses and with assays of bias,
FTLN 1003     By indirections find directions out.
FTLN 1004     So by my former lecture and advice
FTLN 1005     Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?                        75
            REYNALDO
FTLN 1006     My lord, I have.
FTLN 1007   POLONIUS            God be wi’ you. Fare you well.
FTLN 1008   REYNALDO      Good my lord.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1009     Observe his inclination in yourself.
FTLN 1010   REYNALDO I shall, my lord.                                            80
FTLN 1011   POLONIUS And let him ply his music.
FTLN 1012   REYNALDO Well, my lord.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1013     Farewell.                                  Reynaldo exits.

FTLN 1014                 How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?
             79                       Hamlet                      ACT 2. SC. 1




            OPHELIA
FTLN 1015     O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!                    85
FTLN 1016   POLONIUS With what, i’ th’ name of God?
            OPHELIA
FTLN 1017     My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
FTLN 1018     Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced,
FTLN 1019     No hat upon his head, his stockings fouled,
FTLN 1020     Ungartered, and down-gyvèd to his ankle,                           90
FTLN 1021     Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
FTLN 1022     And with a look so piteous in purport
FTLN 1023     As if he had been loosèd out of hell
FTLN 1024     To speak of horrors—he comes before me.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1025     Mad for thy love?                                                  95
FTLN 1026   OPHELIA                 My lord, I do not know,
FTLN 1027     But truly I do fear it.
FTLN 1028   POLONIUS                  What said he?
            OPHELIA
FTLN 1029     He took me by the wrist and held me hard.
FTLN 1030     Then goes he to the length of all his arm,                         100
FTLN 1031     And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,
FTLN 1032     He falls to such perusal of my face
FTLN 1033     As he would draw it. Long stayed he so.
FTLN 1034     At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
FTLN 1035     And thrice his head thus waving up and down,                       105
FTLN 1036     He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
FTLN 1037     As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
FTLN 1038     And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
FTLN 1039     And, with his head over his shoulder turned,
FTLN 1040     He seemed to find his way without his eyes,                        110
FTLN 1041     For out o’ doors he went without their helps
FTLN 1042     And to the last bended their light on me.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1043     Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
FTLN 1044     This is the very ecstasy of love,
FTLN 1045     Whose violent property fordoes itself                              115
             81                      Hamlet                          ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1046     And leads the will to desperate undertakings
FTLN 1047     As oft as any passions under heaven
FTLN 1048     That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
FTLN 1049     What, have you given him any hard words of late?
            OPHELIA
FTLN 1050     No, my good lord, but as you did command                              120
FTLN 1051     I did repel his letters and denied
FTLN 1052     His access to me.
FTLN 1053   POLONIUS                That hath made him mad.
FTLN 1054     I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
FTLN 1055     I had not coted him. I feared he did but trifle                       125
FTLN 1056     And meant to wrack thee. But beshrew my jealousy!
FTLN 1057     By heaven, it is as proper to our age
FTLN 1058     To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
FTLN 1059     As it is common for the younger sort
FTLN 1060     To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.                          130
FTLN 1061     This must be known, which, being kept close, might
FTLN 1062        move
FTLN 1063     More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
FTLN 1064     Come.
                                                              They exit.

            KING
FTLN 1065     Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
FTLN 1066     Moreover that we much did long to see you,
FTLN 1067     The need we have to use you did provoke
FTLN 1068     Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
FTLN 1069     Of Hamlet’s transformation, so call it,                               5
FTLN 1070     Sith nor th’ exterior nor the inward man
FTLN 1071     Resembles that it was. What it should be,
FTLN 1072     More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him
             83                      Hamlet                      ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1073     So much from th’ understanding of himself
FTLN 1074     I cannot dream of. I entreat you both                             10
FTLN 1075     That, being of so young days brought up with him
FTLN 1076     And sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,
FTLN 1077     That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
FTLN 1078     Some little time, so by your companies
FTLN 1079     To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather                        15
FTLN 1080     So much as from occasion you may glean,
FTLN 1081      Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
FTLN 1082     That, opened, lies within our remedy.
            QUEEN
FTLN 1083     Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,
FTLN 1084     And sure I am two men there is not living                         20
FTLN 1085     To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
FTLN 1086     To show us so much gentry and goodwill
FTLN 1087     As to expend your time with us awhile
FTLN 1088     For the supply and profit of our hope,
FTLN 1089     Your visitation shall receive such thanks                         25
FTLN 1090     As fits a king’s remembrance.
FTLN 1091   ROSENCRANTZ                        Both your Majesties
FTLN 1092     Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
FTLN 1093     Put your dread pleasures more into command
FTLN 1094     Than to entreaty.                                                 30

FTLN 1107     Th’ ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
FTLN 1108     Are joyfully returned.
            KING
FTLN 1109     Thou still hast been the father of good news.                      45
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1110     Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege
FTLN 1111     I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
FTLN 1112     Both to my God and to my gracious king,
FTLN 1113     And I do think, or else this brain of mine
FTLN 1114     Hunts not the trail of policy so sure                              50
FTLN 1115     As it hath used to do, that I have found
FTLN 1116     The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.
            KING
FTLN 1117     O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1118     Give first admittance to th’ ambassadors.
FTLN 1119     My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.                    55

FTLN 1120     Thyself do grace to them and bring them in.

FTLN 1121     He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
FTLN 1122     The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
            QUEEN
FTLN 1123     I doubt it is no other but the main—

FTLN 1125     Well, we shall sift him.

             87                       Hamlet                      ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1126                             Welcome, my good friends.
FTLN 1127     Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
            VOLTEMAND
FTLN 1128      Most fair return of greetings and desires.
FTLN 1129      Upon our first, he sent out to suppress                           65
FTLN 1130      His nephew’s levies, which to him appeared
FTLN 1131      To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack,
FTLN 1132      But, better looked into, he truly found
FTLN 1133      It was against your Highness. Whereat, grieved
FTLN 1134      That so his sickness, age, and impotence                          70
FTLN 1135      Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
FTLN 1136      On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,
FTLN 1137      Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
FTLN 1138      Makes vow before his uncle never more
FTLN 1139      To give th’ assay of arms against your Majesty.                   75
FTLN 1140      Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
FTLN 1141      Gives him three-score thousand crowns in annual
FTLN 1142         fee
FTLN 1143      And his commission to employ those soldiers,
FTLN 1144      So levied as before, against the Polack,                          80
FTLN 1145      With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                         He gives a paper.
FTLN 1146      That it might please you to give quiet pass
FTLN 1147      Through your dominions for this enterprise,
FTLN 1148      On such regards of safety and allowance
FTLN 1149      As therein are set down.                                          85
FTLN 1150   KING                           It likes us well,
FTLN 1151      And, at our more considered time, we’ll read,
FTLN 1152      Answer, and think upon this business.
FTLN 1153      Meantime, we thank you for your well-took labor.
FTLN 1154      Go to your rest. At night we’ll feast together.                   90
FTLN 1155      Most welcome home!

FTLN 1156   POLONIUS                    This business is well ended.
FTLN 1157      My liege, and madam, to expostulate
FTLN 1158      What majesty should be, what duty is,

FTLN 1159     Why day is day, night night, and time is time                        95
FTLN 1160     Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
FTLN 1161     Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
FTLN 1162     And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
FTLN 1163     I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
FTLN 1164     “Mad” call I it, for, to define true madness,                        100
FTLN 1165     What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad?
FTLN 1166     But let that go.
FTLN 1167   QUEEN                More matter with less art.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1168     Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
FTLN 1169     That he’s mad, ’tis true; ’tis true ’tis pity,                       105
FTLN 1170     And pity ’tis ’tis true—a foolish figure,
FTLN 1171     But farewell it, for I will use no art.
FTLN 1172     Mad let us grant him then, and now remains
FTLN 1173     That we find out the cause of this effect,
FTLN 1174     Or, rather say, the cause of this defect,                            110
FTLN 1175     For this effect defective comes by cause.
FTLN 1176     Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
FTLN 1177     Perpend.
FTLN 1178     I have a daughter (have while she is mine)
FTLN 1179     Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,                                115
FTLN 1180     Hath given me this. Now gather and surmise.
FTLN 1181          He reads. To the celestial, and my soul’s idol, the
FTLN 1182        most beautified Ophelia—
FTLN 1183        That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; “beautified” is a
FTLN 1184        vile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: He reads.                  120
FTLN 1185        In her excellent white bosom, these, etc.—
FTLN 1186   QUEEN Came this from Hamlet to her?
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1187     Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.
                He reads the letter.
FTLN 1188              Doubt thou the stars are fire,
FTLN 1189                Doubt that the sun doth move,                             125
FTLN 1190              Doubt truth to be a liar,
FTLN 1191                But never doubt I love.

FTLN 1192        O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not
FTLN 1193        art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, O
FTLN 1194        most best, believe it. Adieu.                                     130
FTLN 1195                           Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst
FTLN 1196                                   this machine is to him, Hamlet.
FTLN 1197      This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
FTLN 1198      And more above, hath his solicitings,
FTLN 1199      As they fell out by time, by means, and place,                      135
FTLN 1200      All given to mine ear.
FTLN 1201   KING But how hath she received his love?
FTLN 1202   POLONIUS What do you think of me?
            KING
FTLN 1203     As of a man faithful and honorable.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1204      I would fain prove so. But what might you think,                    140
FTLN 1205      When I had seen this hot love on the wing
FTLN 1206      (As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
FTLN 1207      Before my daughter told me), what might you,
FTLN 1208      Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
FTLN 1209      If I had played the desk or table-book                              145
FTLN 1210      Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
FTLN 1211      Or looked upon this love with idle sight?
FTLN 1212      What might you think? No, I went round to work,
FTLN 1213      And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
FTLN 1214      “Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.                          150
FTLN 1215      This must not be.” And then I prescripts gave her,
FTLN 1216      That she should lock herself from his resort,
FTLN 1217      Admit no messengers, receive no tokens;
FTLN 1218      Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
FTLN 1219      And he, repelled (a short tale to make),                            155
FTLN 1220      Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
FTLN 1221      Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
FTLN 1222      Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
FTLN 1223      Into the madness wherein now he raves
FTLN 1224      And all we mourn for.                                               160
FTLN 1225   KING , to Queen              Do you think ’tis this?
             93                       Hamlet                      ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1226   QUEEN    It may be, very like.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1227      Hath there been such a time (I would fain know
FTLN 1228        that)
FTLN 1229      That I have positively said “’Tis so,”                            165
FTLN 1230      When it proved otherwise?
FTLN 1231   KING                             Not that I know.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1232      Take this from this, if this be otherwise.
FTLN 1233      If circumstances lead me, I will find
FTLN 1234      Where truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed,                   170
FTLN 1235      Within the center.
FTLN 1236   KING                    How may we try it further?
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1237     You know sometimes he walks four hours together
FTLN 1238     Here in the lobby.
FTLN 1239   QUEEN                So he does indeed.                              175
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1240      At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.
FTLN 1241       To the King. Be you and I behind an arras then.
FTLN 1242      Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
FTLN 1243      And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,
FTLN 1244      Let me be no assistant for a state,                               180
FTLN 1245      But keep a farm and carters.
FTLN 1246   KING                               We will try it.

                          Enter Hamlet reading on a book.

            QUEEN
FTLN 1247     But look where sadly the poor wretch comes
FTLN 1248      reading.
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1249     Away, I do beseech you both, away.                                 185
FTLN 1250     I’ll board him presently. O, give me leave.
                                 King and Queen exit with Attendants.
FTLN 1251     How does my good Lord Hamlet?
FTLN 1252   HAMLET Well, God-a-mercy.
             95                      Hamlet                       ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1253   POLONIUS     Do you know me, my lord?
FTLN 1254   HAMLET Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.                         190
FTLN 1255   POLONIUS Not I, my lord.
FTLN 1256   HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man.
FTLN 1257   POLONIUS Honest, my lord?
FTLN 1258   HAMLET Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to
FTLN 1259       be one man picked out of ten thousand.                           195
FTLN 1260   POLONIUS That’s very true, my lord.
FTLN 1261   HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a dead
FTLN 1262       dog, being a good kissing carrion—Have you a
FTLN 1263       daughter?
FTLN 1264   POLONIUS I have, my lord.                                            200
FTLN 1265   HAMLET Let her not walk i’ th’ sun. Conception is a
FTLN 1266       blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive,
FTLN 1267       friend, look to ’t.
FTLN 1268   POLONIUS , aside      How say you by that? Still harping on
FTLN 1269       my daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I              205
FTLN 1270       was a fishmonger. He is far gone. And truly, in my
FTLN 1271       youth, I suffered much extremity for love, very near
FTLN 1272       this. I’ll speak to him again.—What do you read, my
FTLN 1273       lord?
FTLN 1274   HAMLET Words, words, words.                                          210
FTLN 1275   POLONIUS What is the matter, my lord?
FTLN 1276   HAMLET Between who?
FTLN 1277   POLONIUS I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
FTLN 1278   HAMLET Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here
FTLN 1279       that old men have gray beards, that their faces are              215
FTLN 1280       wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
FTLN 1281       plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of
FTLN 1282       wit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,
FTLN 1283       though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
FTLN 1284       hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for                220
FTLN 1285       yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,
FTLN 1286       you could go backward.
FTLN 1287   POLONIUS , aside      Though this be madness, yet there is
FTLN 1288       method in ’t.—Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
             97                       Hamlet                     ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1289   HAMLET     Into my grave?                                           225
FTLN 1290   POLONIUS Indeed, that’s out of the air. Aside. How
FTLN 1291       pregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness
FTLN 1292       that often madness hits on, which reason and
FTLN 1293        sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
FTLN 1294       will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of               230
FTLN 1295       meeting between him and my daughter.—My lord,
FTLN 1296       I will take my leave of you.
FTLN 1297   HAMLET You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I
FTLN 1298       will more willingly part withal—except my life,
FTLN 1299       except my life, except my life.                                 235
FTLN 1300   POLONIUS Fare you well, my lord.
FTLN 1301   HAMLET , aside     These tedious old fools.

                        Enter Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.

FTLN 1302   POLONIUS   You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
FTLN 1303   ROSENCRANTZ, to Polonius      God save you, sir.
                                                       Polonius exits.
FTLN 1304   GUILDENSTERN My honored lord.                                       240
FTLN 1305   ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord.
FTLN 1306   HAMLET My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
FTLN 1307       Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do
FTLN 1308       you both?
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 1309     As the indifferent children of the earth.                         245
            GUILDENSTERN
FTLN 1310     Happy in that we are not overhappy.
FTLN 1311     On Fortune’s cap, we are not the very button.
FTLN 1312   HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe?
FTLN 1313   ROSENCRANTZ Neither, my lord.
FTLN 1314   HAMLET Then you live about her waist, or in the                     250
FTLN 1315       middle of her favors?
FTLN 1316   GUILDENSTERN Faith, her privates we.
FTLN 1317   HAMLET In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true!
FTLN 1318       She is a strumpet. What news?
FTLN 1319   ROSENCRANTZ None, my lord, but that the world’s                     255
FTLN 1320       grown honest.
             99                     Hamlet                      ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1321   HAMLET     Then is doomsday near. But your news is not
FTLN 1322       true. Let me question more in particular. What
FTLN 1323       have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of
FTLN 1324       Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?                   260
FTLN 1325   GUILDENSTERN Prison, my lord?
FTLN 1326   HAMLET Denmark’s a prison.
FTLN 1327   ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one.
FTLN 1328   HAMLET A goodly one, in which there are many confines,
FTLN 1329       wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’                      265
FTLN 1330       th’ worst.
FTLN 1331   ROSENCRANTZ We think not so, my lord.
FTLN 1332   HAMLET Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is
FTLN 1333       nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it
FTLN 1334       so. To me, it is a prison.                                     270
FTLN 1335   ROSENCRANTZ Why, then, your ambition makes it one.
FTLN 1336       ’Tis too narrow for your mind.
FTLN 1337   HAMLET O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and
FTLN 1338       count myself a king of infinite space, were it not
FTLN 1339       that I have bad dreams.                                        275
FTLN 1340   GUILDENSTERN Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,
FTLN 1341       for the very substance of the ambitious is merely
FTLN 1342       the shadow of a dream.
FTLN 1343   HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow.
FTLN 1344   ROSENCRANTZ Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy                  280
FTLN 1345       and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
FTLN 1346   HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs
FTLN 1347       and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows.
FTLN 1348       Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot
FTLN 1349       reason.                                                        285
FTLN 1350   ROSENCRANTZ/GUILDENSTERN We’ll wait upon you.
FTLN 1351   HAMLET No such matter. I will not sort you with the
FTLN 1352       rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an
FTLN 1353       honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,
FTLN 1354       in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at              290
FTLN 1355       Elsinore?
FTLN 1356   ROSENCRANTZ To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.

FTLN 1357   HAMLET     Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;
FTLN 1358       but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks
FTLN 1359       are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for?                 295
FTLN 1360       Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?
FTLN 1361       Come, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay,
FTLN 1362       speak.
FTLN 1363   GUILDENSTERN What should we say, my lord?
FTLN 1364   HAMLET Anything but to th’ purpose. You were sent                    300
FTLN 1365       for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks
FTLN 1366       which your modesties have not craft enough to
FTLN 1367       color. I know the good king and queen have sent for
FTLN 1368       you.
FTLN 1369   ROSENCRANTZ To what end, my lord?                                    305
FTLN 1370   HAMLET That you must teach me. But let me conjure
FTLN 1371       you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy
FTLN 1372       of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
FTLN 1373       love, and by what more dear a better
FTLN 1374       proposer can charge you withal: be even and direct               310
FTLN 1375       with me whether you were sent for or no.
FTLN 1376   ROSENCRANTZ, to Guildenstern         What say you?
FTLN 1377   HAMLET , aside      Nay, then, I have an eye of you.—If
FTLN 1378       you love me, hold not off.
FTLN 1379   GUILDENSTERN My lord, we were sent for.                              315
FTLN 1380   HAMLET I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
FTLN 1381       prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the
FTLN 1382       King and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but
FTLN 1383       wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all
FTLN 1384       custom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily             320
FTLN 1385       with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
FTLN 1386       Earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most
FTLN 1387       excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging
FTLN 1388       firmament, this majestical roof, fretted
FTLN 1389       with golden fire—why, it appeareth nothing to me                 325
FTLN 1390       but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.
FTLN 1391       What a piece of work is a man, how noble in
FTLN 1392       reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving
             103                     Hamlet                       ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1393       how express and admirable; in action how like
FTLN 1394       an angel, in apprehension how like a god: the                    330
FTLN 1395       beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and
FTLN 1396       yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man
FTLN 1397       delights not me, no, nor women neither, though by
FTLN 1398       your smiling you seem to say so.
FTLN 1399   ROSENCRANTZ My lord, there was no such stuff in my                   335
FTLN 1400       thoughts.
FTLN 1401   HAMLET Why did you laugh, then, when I said “man
FTLN 1402       delights not me”?
FTLN 1403   ROSENCRANTZ To think, my lord, if you delight not in
FTLN 1404       man, what Lenten entertainment the players shall                 340
FTLN 1405       receive from you. We coted them on the way, and
FTLN 1406       hither are they coming to offer you service.
FTLN 1407   HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcome—his
FTLN 1408       Majesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous
FTLN 1409       knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall            345
FTLN 1410       not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his
FTLN 1411       part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh
FTLN 1412       whose lungs are tickle o’ th’ sear, and the lady
FTLN 1413       shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall
FTLN 1414       halt for ’t. What players are they?                              350
FTLN 1415   ROSENCRANTZ Even those you were wont to take such
FTLN 1416       delight in, the tragedians of the city.
FTLN 1417   HAMLET How chances it they travel? Their residence,
FTLN 1418       both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
FTLN 1419   ROSENCRANTZ I think their inhibition comes by the                    355
FTLN 1420       means of the late innovation.
FTLN 1421   HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation they did
FTLN 1422       when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
FTLN 1423   ROSENCRANTZ No, indeed are they not.
FTLN 1424    HAMLET How comes it? Do they grow rusty?                            360
FTLN 1425   ROSENCRANTZ Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted
FTLN 1426       pace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little
FTLN 1427       eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are
FTLN 1428       most tyrannically clapped for ’t. These are now the
             105                      Hamlet                       ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1429       fashion and so berattle the common stages (so                     365
FTLN 1430       they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid
FTLN 1431       of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.
FTLN 1432   HAMLET What, are they children? Who maintains ’em?
FTLN 1433       How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality
FTLN 1434       no longer than they can sing? Will they not say                   370
FTLN 1435       afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
FTLN 1436       players (as it is most like, if their means are
FTLN 1437       no better), their writers do them wrong to make
FTLN 1438       them exclaim against their own succession?
FTLN 1439   ROSENCRANTZ Faith, there has been much to-do on                       375
FTLN 1440       both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar
FTLN 1441       them to controversy. There was for a while no
FTLN 1442       money bid for argument unless the poet and the
FTLN 1443       player went to cuffs in the question.
FTLN 1444   HAMLET Is ’t possible?                                                380
FTLN 1445   GUILDENSTERN O, there has been much throwing
FTLN 1446       about of brains.
FTLN 1447   HAMLET Do the boys carry it away?
FTLN 1448   ROSENCRANTZ Ay, that they do, my lord—Hercules
FTLN 1449       and his load too.                                                 385
FTLN 1450   HAMLET It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of
FTLN 1451       Denmark, and those that would make mouths at
FTLN 1452       him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty,
FTLN 1453       a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.
FTLN 1454       ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,            390
FTLN 1455       if philosophy could find it out.
                                               A flourish for the Players.
FTLN 1456   GUILDENSTERN There are the players.
FTLN 1457   HAMLET Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
FTLN 1458       Your hands, come then. Th’ appurtenance of welcome
FTLN 1459       is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply                            395
FTLN 1460       with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players,
FTLN 1461       which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should
FTLN 1462       more appear like entertainment than yours. You are
FTLN 1463       welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are
FTLN 1464       deceived.                                                         400
             107                      Hamlet                      ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1465   GUILDENSTERN   In what, my dear lord?
FTLN 1466   HAMLET I am but mad north-north-west. When the
FTLN 1467      wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.

                                   Enter Polonius.

FTLN 1468   POLONIUS    Well be with you, gentlemen.
FTLN 1469   HAMLET Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too—at                        405
FTLN 1470       each ear a hearer! That great baby you see there is
FTLN 1471       not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
FTLN 1472   ROSENCRANTZ Haply he is the second time come to
FTLN 1473       them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
FTLN 1474   HAMLET I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the                    410
FTLN 1475       players; mark it.—You say right, sir, a Monday
FTLN 1476       morning, ’twas then indeed.
FTLN 1477   POLONIUS My lord, I have news to tell you.
FTLN 1478   HAMLET My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius
FTLN 1479       was an actor in Rome—                                            415
FTLN 1480   POLONIUS The actors are come hither, my lord.
FTLN 1481   HAMLET Buzz, buzz.
FTLN 1482   POLONIUS Upon my honor—
FTLN 1483   HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass.
FTLN 1484   POLONIUS The best actors in the world, either for                    420
FTLN 1485       tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
FTLN 1486       historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,
FTLN 1487       tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
FTLN 1488       poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
FTLN 1489       Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty,          425
FTLN 1490       these are the only men.
FTLN 1491   HAMLET O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure
FTLN 1492       hadst thou!
FTLN 1493   POLONIUS What a treasure had he, my lord?
FTLN 1494   HAMLET Why,                                                          430
FTLN 1495               One fair daughter, and no more,
FTLN 1496               The which he lovèd passing well.
FTLN 1497   POLONIUS , aside     Still on my daughter.
FTLN 1498   HAMLET Am I not i’ th’ right, old Jephthah?
             109                      Hamlet                       ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1499   POLONIUS     If you call me “Jephthah,” my lord: I have a             435
FTLN 1500       daughter that I love passing well.
FTLN 1501   HAMLET Nay, that follows not.
FTLN 1502   POLONIUS What follows then, my lord?
FTLN 1503   HAMLET Why,
FTLN 1504                        As by lot, God wot                               440
FTLN 1505       and then, you know,
FTLN 1506              It came to pass, as most like it was—
FTLN 1507       the first row of the pious chanson will show you
FTLN 1508       more, for look where my abridgment comes.

                                  Enter the Players.

FTLN 1509        You are welcome, masters; welcome all.—I am glad                 445
FTLN 1510        to see thee well.—Welcome, good friends.—O my
FTLN 1511        old friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee
FTLN 1512        last. Com’st thou to beard me in Denmark?—What,
FTLN 1513        my young lady and mistress! By ’r Lady, your Ladyship
FTLN 1514        is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by                 450
FTLN 1515        the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a
FTLN 1516        piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
FTLN 1517        ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to ’t
FTLN 1518        like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We’ll
FTLN 1519        have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your            455
FTLN 1520        quality. Come, a passionate speech.
FTLN 1521    FIRST PLAYER What speech, my good lord?
FTLN 1522   HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it
FTLN 1523        was never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for
FTLN 1524        the play, I remember, pleased not the million:                   460
FTLN 1525        ’twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I
FTLN 1526        received it, and others whose judgments in such
FTLN 1527        matters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play,
FTLN 1528        well digested in the scenes, set down with as much
FTLN 1529        modesty as cunning. I remember one said there                    465
FTLN 1530        were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
FTLN 1531        savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict
FTLN 1532        the author of affection, but called it an honest
             111                      Hamlet                       ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1533        method, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much,
FTLN 1534        more handsome than fine. One speech in ’t I                      470
FTLN 1535        chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and
FTLN 1536        thereabout of it especially when he speaks of
FTLN 1537        Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at
FTLN 1538        this line—let me see, let me see:
FTLN 1539      The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast—                      475
FTLN 1540        ’tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
FTLN 1541      The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
FTLN 1542      Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
FTLN 1543      When he lay couchèd in th’ ominous horse,
FTLN 1544      Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared                   480
FTLN 1545      With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,
FTLN 1546      Now is he total gules, horridly tricked
FTLN 1547      With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
FTLN 1548      Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
FTLN 1549      That lend a tyrannous and a damnèd light                           485
FTLN 1550      To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,
FTLN 1551      And thus o’ersizèd with coagulate gore,
FTLN 1552      With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
FTLN 1553      Old grandsire Priam seeks.
FTLN 1554        So, proceed you.                                                 490
FTLN 1555   POLONIUS ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good
FTLN 1556        accent and good discretion.
FTLN 1557    FIRST PLAYER                       Anon he finds him
FTLN 1558      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
FTLN 1559      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,                        495
FTLN 1560      Repugnant to command. Unequal matched,
FTLN 1561      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
FTLN 1562      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
FTLN 1563      Th’ unnervèd father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
FTLN 1564      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top                        500
FTLN 1565      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
FTLN 1566      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,
FTLN 1567      Which was declining on the milky head
FTLN 1568      Of reverend Priam, seemed i’ th’ air to stick.
             113                      Hamlet                        ACT 2. SC. 2




FTLN 1569     So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood                                 505
FTLN 1570      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
FTLN 1571     Did nothing.
FTLN 1572     But as we often see against some storm
FTLN 1573     A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
FTLN 1574     The bold winds speechless, and the orb below                         510
FTLN 1575     As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
FTLN 1576     Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,
FTLN 1577     Arousèd vengeance sets him new a-work,
FTLN 1578     And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall
FTLN 1579     On Mars’s armor, forged for proof eterne,                            515
FTLN 1580     With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword
FTLN 1581     Now falls on Priam.
FTLN 1582     Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods
FTLN 1583     In general synod take away her power,
FTLN 1584     Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,                     520
FTLN 1585     And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
FTLN 1586     As low as to the fiends!
FTLN 1587   POLONIUS This is too long.
FTLN 1588   HAMLET It shall to the barber’s with your beard.—
FTLN 1589       Prithee say on. He’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or             525
FTLN 1590       he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.
            FIRST PLAYER
FTLN 1591     But who, ah woe, had seen the moblèd queen—
FTLN 1592   HAMLET “The moblèd queen”?
FTLN 1593   POLONIUS That’s good. “ Moblèd queen” is good.
            FIRST PLAYER
FTLN 1594     Run barefoot up and down, threat’ning the flames                     530
FTLN 1595     With bisson rheum, a clout upon that head
FTLN 1596     Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
FTLN 1597     About her lank and all o’erteemèd loins
FTLN 1598     A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up—
FTLN 1599     Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped,                     535
FTLN 1600     ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have
FTLN 1601       pronounced.
FTLN 1602     But if the gods themselves did see her then

FTLN 1603      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
FTLN 1604      In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs,                540
FTLN 1605      The instant burst of clamor that she made
FTLN 1606      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
FTLN 1607      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
FTLN 1608      And passion in the gods.
FTLN 1609   POLONIUS Look whe’er he has not turned his color and             545
FTLN 1610        has tears in ’s eyes. Prithee, no more.
FTLN 1611   HAMLET ’Tis well. I’ll have thee speak out the rest of
FTLN 1612        this soon.—Good my lord, will you see the players
FTLN 1613        well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used,
FTLN 1614        for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the       550
FTLN 1615        time. After your death you were better have a bad
FTLN 1616        epitaph than their ill report while you live.
FTLN 1617   POLONIUS My lord, I will use them according to their
FTLN 1618        desert.
FTLN 1619   HAMLET God’s bodykins, man, much better! Use every               555
FTLN 1620        man after his desert and who shall ’scape
FTLN 1621        whipping? Use them after your own honor and
FTLN 1622        dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
FTLN 1623        your bounty. Take them in.
FTLN 1624   POLONIUS Come, sirs.                                             560
FTLN 1625   HAMLET Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play
FTLN 1626        tomorrow. As Polonius and Players exit, Hamlet speaks to
FTLN 1627        the First Player. Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can
FTLN 1628        you play “The Murder of Gonzago”?
FTLN 1629    FIRST PLAYER Ay, my lord.                                       565
FTLN 1630   HAMLET We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night. You could, for a
FTLN 1631        need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen
FTLN 1632        lines, which I would set down and insert in ’t,
FTLN 1633        could you not?
FTLN 1634    FIRST PLAYER Ay, my lord.                                       570
FTLN 1635   HAMLET Very well. Follow that lord—and look you
FTLN 1636        mock him not. First Player exits. My good friends,
FTLN 1637        I’ll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.

FTLN 1639     Ay, so, good-bye to you.                                          575
                                       Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.

FTLN 1641     O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
FTLN 1642     Is it not monstrous that this player here,
FTLN 1643     But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
FTLN 1644     Could force his soul so to his own conceit                        580
FTLN 1645     That from her working all his visage wanned,
FTLN 1646     Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,
FTLN 1647     A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
FTLN 1648     With forms to his conceit—and all for nothing!
FTLN 1649     For Hecuba!                                                       585
FTLN 1650     What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
FTLN 1651     That he should weep for her? What would he do
FTLN 1652     Had he the motive and the cue for passion
FTLN 1653     That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
FTLN 1654     And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,                    590
FTLN 1655     Make mad the guilty and appall the free,
FTLN 1656     Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
FTLN 1657     The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
FTLN 1658     A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
FTLN 1659     Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,                       595
FTLN 1660     And can say nothing—no, not for a king
FTLN 1661     Upon whose property and most dear life
FTLN 1662     A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?
FTLN 1663     Who calls me “villain”? breaks my pate across?
FTLN 1664     Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?                      600
FTLN 1665     Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ th’ throat
FTLN 1666     As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?
FTLN 1667     Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot be
FTLN 1668     But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall
FTLN 1669     To make oppression bitter, or ere this                            605
FTLN 1670     I should have fatted all the region kites
FTLN 1671     With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!
FTLN 1672     Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless
FTLN 1673        villain!

FTLN 1674     O vengeance!                                                    610
FTLN 1675    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
FTLN 1676    That I, the son of a dear father murdered,
FTLN 1677    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
FTLN 1678    Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words
FTLN 1679    And fall a-cursing like a very drab,                             615
FTLN 1680    A stallion! Fie upon ’t! Foh!
FTLN 1681    About, my brains!—Hum, I have heard
FTLN 1682    That guilty creatures sitting at a play
FTLN 1683    Have, by the very cunning of the scene,
FTLN 1684    Been struck so to the soul that presently                        620
FTLN 1685    They have proclaimed their malefactions;
FTLN 1686    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
FTLN 1687    With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players
FTLN 1688    Play something like the murder of my father
FTLN 1689    Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;                       625
FTLN 1690    I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,
FTLN 1691    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
FTLN 1692    May be a devil, and the devil hath power
FTLN 1693    T’ assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,
FTLN 1694    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,                            630
FTLN 1695    As he is very potent with such spirits,
FTLN 1696    Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds
FTLN 1697    More relative than this. The play’s the thing
FTLN 1698    Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.

            KING
FTLN 1699     And can you by no drift of conference
FTLN 1700     Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
FTLN 1701     Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
FTLN 1702     With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 1703     He does confess he feels himself distracted,              5
FTLN 1704     But from what cause he will by no means speak.
            GUILDENSTERN
FTLN 1705     Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
FTLN 1706     But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
FTLN 1707     When we would bring him on to some confession
FTLN 1708     Of his true state.                                        10
FTLN 1709   QUEEN                Did he receive you well?
FTLN 1710   ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman.
            GUILDENSTERN
FTLN 1711     But with much forcing of his disposition.
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 1712     Niggard of question, but of our demands
FTLN 1713     Most free in his reply.                                   15
FTLN 1714   QUEEN Did you assay him to any pastime?
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 1715     Madam, it so fell out that certain players
                                          123

FTLN 1716     We o’erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
FTLN 1717     And there did seem in him a kind of joy
FTLN 1718     To hear of it. They are here about the court,                          20
FTLN 1719     And, as I think, they have already order
FTLN 1720     This night to play before him.
FTLN 1721   POLONIUS                           ’Tis most true,
FTLN 1722     And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties
FTLN 1723     To hear and see the matter.                                            25
            KING
FTLN 1724      With all my heart, and it doth much content me
FTLN 1725      To hear him so inclined.
FTLN 1726      Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
FTLN 1727      And drive his purpose into these delights.
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 1728      We shall, my lord.                Rosencrantz and Guildenstern        30

FTLN 1729   KING                       Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,
FTLN 1730      For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
FTLN 1731      That he, as ’twere by accident, may here
FTLN 1732      Affront Ophelia.
FTLN 1733      Her father and myself, lawful espials,                                35
FTLN 1734       Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
FTLN 1735      We may of their encounter frankly judge
FTLN 1736      And gather by him, as he is behaved,
FTLN 1737      If ’t be th’ affliction of his love or no
FTLN 1738      That thus he suffers for.                                             40
FTLN 1739   QUEEN                             I shall obey you.
FTLN 1740      And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
FTLN 1741      That your good beauties be the happy cause
FTLN 1742      Of Hamlet’s wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
FTLN 1743      Will bring him to his wonted way again,                               45

FTLN 1747      We will bestow ourselves. To Ophelia. Read on this

FTLN 1749      That show of such an exercise may color

FTLN 1757      The harlot’s cheek beautied with plast’ring art

FTLN 1759      Than is my deed to my most painted word.
FTLN 1760      O heavy burden!

FTLN 1761     I hear him coming. Let’s withdraw, my lord.

            HAMLET
FTLN 1762     To be or not to be—that is the question:
FTLN 1763     Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer                           65
FTLN 1764     The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
FTLN 1765     Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
FTLN 1766     And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep—
FTLN 1767     No more—and by a sleep to say we end
FTLN 1768     The heartache and the thousand natural shocks                       70
FTLN 1769     That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation
FTLN 1770     Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep—
FTLN 1771     To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there’s the rub,
FTLN 1772     For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
FTLN 1773     When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,                         75
FTLN 1774     Must give us pause. There’s the respect
FTLN 1775     That makes calamity of so long life.
FTLN 1776     For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
FTLN 1777     Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
             129                     Hamlet                     ACT 3. SC. 1




FTLN 1778     The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,                     80
FTLN 1779     The insolence of office, and the spurns
FTLN 1780     That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,
FTLN 1781     When he himself might his quietus make
FTLN 1782     With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
FTLN 1783     To grunt and sweat under a weary life,                           85
FTLN 1784     But that the dread of something after death,
FTLN 1785     The undiscovered country from whose bourn
FTLN 1786     No traveler returns, puzzles the will
FTLN 1787     And makes us rather bear those ills we have
FTLN 1788     Than fly to others that we know not of?                          90
FTLN 1789     Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
FTLN 1790     And thus the native hue of resolution
FTLN 1791     Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
FTLN 1792     And enterprises of great pitch and moment
FTLN 1793     With this regard their currents turn awry                        95
FTLN 1794     And lose the name of action.—Soft you now,
FTLN 1795     The fair Ophelia.—Nymph, in thy orisons
FTLN 1796     Be all my sins remembered.
FTLN 1797   OPHELIA                           Good my lord,

FTLN 1799   HAMLET I humbly thank you, well.
            OPHELIA
FTLN 1800     My lord, I have remembrances of yours
FTLN 1801     That I have longèd long to redeliver.
FTLN 1802     I pray you now receive them.
            HAMLET
FTLN 1803     No, not I. I never gave you aught.                               105
            OPHELIA
FTLN 1804     My honored lord, you know right well you did,
FTLN 1805     And with them words of so sweet breath composed
FTLN 1806     As made the things more rich. Their perfume
FTLN 1807       lost,
FTLN 1808     Take these again, for to the noble mind                          110
FTLN 1809     Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
FTLN 1810     There, my lord.

FTLN 1811   HAMLET    Ha, ha, are you honest?
FTLN 1812   OPHELIA My lord?
FTLN 1813   HAMLET Are you fair?                                               115
FTLN 1814   OPHELIA What means your Lordship?
FTLN 1815   HAMLET That if you be honest and fair, your honesty
FTLN 1816       should admit no discourse to your beauty.
FTLN 1817   OPHELIA Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce
FTLN 1818       than with honesty?                                             120
FTLN 1819   HAMLET Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner
FTLN 1820       transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than
FTLN 1821       the force of honesty can translate beauty into his
FTLN 1822       likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now
FTLN 1823       the time gives it proof. I did love you once.                  125
FTLN 1824   OPHELIA Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
FTLN 1825   HAMLET You should not have believed me, for virtue
FTLN 1826       cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall
FTLN 1827       relish of it. I loved you not.
FTLN 1828   OPHELIA I was the more deceived.                                   130
FTLN 1829   HAMLET Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be
FTLN 1830       a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,
FTLN 1831       but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
FTLN 1832       were better my mother had not borne me: I am
FTLN 1833       very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses          135
FTLN 1834       at my beck than I have thoughts to put them
FTLN 1835       in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act
FTLN 1836       them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
FTLN 1837       between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves
FTLN 1838        all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.            140
FTLN 1839       Where’s your father?
FTLN 1840   OPHELIA At home, my lord.
FTLN 1841   HAMLET Let the doors be shut upon him that he may
FTLN 1842       play the fool nowhere but in ’s own house. Farewell.
FTLN 1843   OPHELIA O, help him, you sweet heavens!                            145
FTLN 1844   HAMLET If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague
FTLN 1845       for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
FTLN 1846       snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a

FTLN 1847       nunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,
FTLN 1848       marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what                    150
FTLN 1849       monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and
FTLN 1850       quickly too. Farewell.
FTLN 1851   OPHELIA Heavenly powers, restore him!
FTLN 1852   HAMLET I have heard of your paintings too, well
FTLN 1853       enough. God hath given you one face, and you                        155
FTLN 1854       make yourselves another. You jig and amble, and
FTLN 1855       you lisp; you nickname God’s creatures and make
FTLN 1856       your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no
FTLN 1857       more on ’t. It hath made me mad. I say we will have
FTLN 1858       no more marriage. Those that are married already,                   160
FTLN 1859       all but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.

FTLN 1861      O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown!
FTLN 1862      The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue,
FTLN 1863         sword,                                                            165
FTLN 1864       Th’ expectancy and rose of the fair state,
FTLN 1865      The glass of fashion and the mold of form,
FTLN 1866      Th’ observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
FTLN 1867      And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
FTLN 1868      That sucked the honey of his musicked vows,                          170
FTLN 1869      Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
FTLN 1870      Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;
FTLN 1871      That unmatched form and stature of blown youth
FTLN 1872      Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
FTLN 1873      T’ have seen what I have seen, see what I see!                       175
            KING , advancing with Polonius
FTLN 1874      Love? His affections do not that way tend;
FTLN 1875      Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,
FTLN 1876      Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul
FTLN 1877      O’er which his melancholy sits on brood,
FTLN 1878      And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose                            180
FTLN 1879      Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
FTLN 1880      I have in quick determination
             135                       Hamlet                         ACT 3. SC. 2




FTLN 1881      Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
FTLN 1882      For the demand of our neglected tribute.
FTLN 1883      Haply the seas, and countries different,                              185
FTLN 1884      With variable objects, shall expel
FTLN 1885      This something-settled matter in his heart,
FTLN 1886      Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
FTLN 1887      From fashion of himself. What think you on ’t?
            POLONIUS
FTLN 1888      It shall do well. But yet do I believe                                190
FTLN 1889      The origin and commencement of his grief
FTLN 1890      Sprung from neglected love.—How now, Ophelia?
FTLN 1891      You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
FTLN 1892      We heard it all.—My lord, do as you please,
FTLN 1893      But, if you hold it fit, after the play                               195
FTLN 1894      Let his queen-mother all alone entreat him
FTLN 1895      To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
FTLN 1896      And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear
FTLN 1897      Of all their conference. If she find him not,
FTLN 1898      To England send him, or confine him where                             200
FTLN 1899      Your wisdom best shall think.
FTLN 1900   KING                                    It shall be so.
FTLN 1901      Madness in great ones must not unwatched go.
                                                                    They exit.

                         Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

FTLN 1902   HAMLET      Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced
FTLN 1903        it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth
FTLN 1904        it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the
FTLN 1905        town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
FTLN 1906        too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;                  5
FTLN 1907        for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
FTLN 1908        whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and
FTLN 1909        beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,
             137                      Hamlet                       ACT 3. SC. 2




FTLN 1910       it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,
FTLN 1911       periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very           10
FTLN 1912       rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the
FTLN 1913       most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable
FTLN 1914       dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow
FTLN 1915       whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods
FTLN 1916       Herod. Pray you, avoid it.                                        15
FTLN 1917   PLAYER I warrant your Honor.
FTLN 1918   HAMLET Be not too tame neither, but let your own
FTLN 1919       discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the
FTLN 1920       word, the word to the action, with this special
FTLN 1921       observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of                  20
FTLN 1922       nature. For anything so o’erdone is from the purpose
FTLN 1923       of playing, whose end, both at the first and
FTLN 1924       now, was and is to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to
FTLN 1925       nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her
FTLN 1926       own image, and the very age and body of the time                  25
FTLN 1927       his form and pressure. Now this overdone or come
FTLN 1928       tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh,
FTLN 1929       cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure
FTLN 1930       of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh
FTLN 1931       a whole theater of others. O, there be players that I             30
FTLN 1932       have seen play and heard others praise (and that
FTLN 1933       highly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither
FTLN 1934       having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of
FTLN 1935       Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and
FTLN 1936       bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s                     35
FTLN 1937       journeymen had made men, and not made them
FTLN 1938       well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
FTLN 1939   PLAYER I hope we have reformed that indifferently
FTLN 1940       with us, sir.
FTLN 1941   HAMLET O, reform it altogether. And let those that play               40
FTLN 1942       your clowns speak no more than is set down for
FTLN 1943       them, for there be of them that will themselves
FTLN 1944       laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators
FTLN 1945       to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary

FTLN 1946       question of the play be then to be considered.                     45
FTLN 1947       That’s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition
FTLN 1948       in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.
                                                             Players exit.

                   Enter Polonius, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz.

FTLN 1949       How now, my lord, will the King hear this piece of
FTLN 1950       work?
FTLN 1951   POLONIUS And the Queen too, and that presently.                        50
FTLN 1952   HAMLET Bid the players make haste.          Polonius exits.
FTLN 1953       Will you two help to hasten them?
FTLN 1954   ROSENCRANTZ Ay, my lord.                          They exit.
FTLN 1955   HAMLET What ho, Horatio!


                                   Enter Horatio.

FTLN 1956   HORATIO   Here, sweet lord, at your service.                           55
            HAMLET
FTLN 1957     Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man
FTLN 1958     As e’er my conversation coped withal.
            HORATIO
FTLN 1959     O, my dear lord—
FTLN 1960   HAMLET                 Nay, do not think I flatter,
FTLN 1961     For what advancement may I hope from thee                            60
FTLN 1962     That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
FTLN 1963     To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be
FTLN 1964       flattered?
FTLN 1965     No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
FTLN 1966     And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee                            65
FTLN 1967     Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
FTLN 1968     Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
FTLN 1969     And could of men distinguish, her election
FTLN 1970     Hath sealed thee for herself. For thou hast been
FTLN 1971     As one in suffering all that suffers nothing,                        70
FTLN 1972     A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards
FTLN 1973     Hast ta’en with equal thanks; and blessed are those
FTLN 1974     Whose blood and judgment are so well

FTLN 1976     That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger                        75
FTLN 1977     To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
FTLN 1978     That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him
FTLN 1979     In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart,
FTLN 1980     As I do thee.—Something too much of this.—
FTLN 1981     There is a play tonight before the King.                             80
FTLN 1982     One scene of it comes near the circumstance
FTLN 1983     Which I have told thee of my father’s death.
FTLN 1984     I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
FTLN 1985     Even with the very comment of thy soul
FTLN 1986     Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt                              85
FTLN 1987     Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
FTLN 1988     It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen,
FTLN 1989     And my imaginations are as foul
FTLN 1990     As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note,
FTLN 1991     For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,                              90
FTLN 1992     And, after, we will both our judgments join
FTLN 1993     In censure of his seeming.
FTLN 1994   HORATIO                         Well, my lord.
FTLN 1995     If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
FTLN 1996     And ’scape detecting , I will pay the theft.                         95
                                                          Sound a flourish.
FTLN 1997   HAMLET They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
FTLN 1998        Get you a place.

               Enter Trumpets and Kettle Drums. Enter King, Queen,
              Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and other
                  Lords attendant with the King’s guard carrying
                                      torches.

FTLN 1999   KING   How fares our cousin Hamlet?
FTLN 2000   HAMLET Excellent, i’ faith, of the chameleon’s dish. I
FTLN 2001       eat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed                      100
FTLN 2002       capons so.
FTLN 2003   KING I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These
FTLN 2004       words are not mine.
FTLN 2005   HAMLET No, nor mine now. To Polonius. My lord, you
FTLN 2006       played once i’ th’ university, you say?                            105

FTLN 2007   POLONIUS     That did I, my lord, and was accounted a
FTLN 2008       good actor.
FTLN 2009   HAMLET What did you enact?
FTLN 2010   POLONIUS I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i’ th’
FTLN 2011       Capitol. Brutus killed me.                                      110
FTLN 2012   HAMLET It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a
FTLN 2013       calf there.—Be the players ready?
FTLN 2014   ROSENCRANTZ Ay, my lord. They stay upon your
FTLN 2015       patience.
FTLN 2016   QUEEN Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.                       115
FTLN 2017   HAMLET No, good mother. Here’s metal more
FTLN 2018       attractive.           Hamlet takes a place near Ophelia.
FTLN 2019   POLONIUS , to the King       Oh, ho! Do you mark that?
FTLN 2020   HAMLET Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
FTLN 2021   OPHELIA No, my lord.                                                120
FTLN 2022    HAMLET I mean, my head upon your lap?
FTLN 2023   OPHELIA Ay, my lord.
FTLN 2024   HAMLET Do you think I meant country matters?
FTLN 2025   OPHELIA I think nothing, my lord.
FTLN 2026   HAMLET That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’                  125
FTLN 2027       legs.
FTLN 2028   OPHELIA What is, my lord?
FTLN 2029   HAMLET Nothing.
FTLN 2030   OPHELIA You are merry, my lord.
FTLN 2031   HAMLET Who, I?                                                      130
FTLN 2032   OPHELIA Ay, my lord.
FTLN 2033   HAMLET O God, your only jig-maker. What should a
FTLN 2034       man do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully
FTLN 2035       my mother looks, and my father died within ’s two
FTLN 2036       hours.                                                          135
FTLN 2037   OPHELIA Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.
FTLN 2038   HAMLET So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,
FTLN 2039       for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die two
FTLN 2040       months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s
FTLN 2041       hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half             140

FTLN 2046   Enter a King and a Queen, very lovingly, the Queen                   145
FTLN 2047   embracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show of
FTLN 2048   protestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his
FTLN 2049   head upon her neck. He lies him down upon a bank of
FTLN 2050   flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon
FTLN 2051    comes in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours         150
FTLN 2052   poison in the sleeper’s ears, and leaves him. The Queen
FTLN 2053   returns, finds the King dead, makes passionate action. The
FTLN 2054   poisoner with some three or four come in again, seem to
FTLN 2055   condole with her. The dead body is carried away. The
FTLN 2056   poisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems harsh                  155

FTLN 2058   OPHELIA What means this, my lord?
FTLN 2059   HAMLET Marry, this is miching mallecho. It means

FTLN 2061   OPHELIA Belike this show imports the argument of the                 160

FTLN 2065   OPHELIA Will he tell us what this show meant?
FTLN 2066   HAMLET Ay, or any show that you will show him. Be                    165
FTLN 2067       not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you

FTLN 2074   HAMLET     Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?
FTLN 2075   OPHELIA    ’Tis brief, my lord.
FTLN 2076   HAMLET     As woman’s love.                                            175

                          Enter the Player King and Queen.

            PLAYER KING
FTLN 2077     Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round
FTLN 2078     Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbèd ground,
FTLN 2079     And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
FTLN 2080     About the world have times twelve thirties been
FTLN 2081     Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands                        180
FTLN 2082     Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
            PLAYER QUEEN
FTLN 2083     So many journeys may the sun and moon
FTLN 2084     Make us again count o’er ere love be done!
FTLN 2085     But woe is me! You are so sick of late,
FTLN 2086     So far from cheer and from your former state,                        185
FTLN 2087     That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
FTLN 2088     Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.
FTLN 2089      For women fear too much, even as they love,
FTLN 2090     And women’s fear and love hold quantity,
FTLN 2091     In neither aught, or in extremity.                                   190
FTLN 2092     Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,
FTLN 2093     And, as my love is sized, my fear is so:
FTLN 2094      Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
FTLN 2095     Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
            PLAYER KING
FTLN 2096     Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too.                     195
FTLN 2097     My operant powers their functions leave to do.
FTLN 2098     And thou shall live in this fair world behind,
FTLN 2099     Honored, beloved; and haply one as kind
FTLN 2100     For husband shalt thou—
FTLN 2101   PLAYER QUEEN                    O, confound the rest!                  200
FTLN 2102     Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
FTLN 2103     In second husband let me be accurst.
FTLN 2104     None wed the second but who killed the first.
             149                      Hamlet                    ACT 3. SC. 2




FTLN 2105   HAMLET    That’s wormwood!
            PLAYER QUEEN
FTLN 2106     The instances that second marriage move                          205
FTLN 2107     Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
FTLN 2108     A second time I kill my husband dead
FTLN 2109     When second husband kisses me in bed.
            PLAYER KING
FTLN 2110     I do believe you think what now you speak,
FTLN 2111     But what we do determine oft we break.                           210
FTLN 2112     Purpose is but the slave to memory,
FTLN 2113     Of violent birth, but poor validity,
FTLN 2114     Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree
FTLN 2115     But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
FTLN 2116     Most necessary ’tis that we forget                               215
FTLN 2117     To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
FTLN 2118     What to ourselves in passion we propose,
FTLN 2119     The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
FTLN 2120     The violence of either grief or joy
FTLN 2121     Their own enactures with themselves destroy.                     220
FTLN 2122     Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
FTLN 2123     Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
FTLN 2124     This world is not for aye, nor ’tis not strange
FTLN 2125     That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
FTLN 2126     For ’tis a question left us yet to prove                         225
FTLN 2127     Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love.
FTLN 2128     The great man down, you mark his favorite flies;
FTLN 2129     The poor, advanced, makes friends of enemies.
FTLN 2130     And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
FTLN 2131     For who not needs shall never lack a friend,                     230
FTLN 2132     And who in want a hollow friend doth try
FTLN 2133     Directly seasons him his enemy.
FTLN 2134     But, orderly to end where I begun:
FTLN 2135     Our wills and fates do so contrary run
FTLN 2136     That our devices still are overthrown;                           235
FTLN 2137     Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
FTLN 2138     So think thou wilt no second husband wed,
FTLN 2139     But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
             151                      Hamlet                        ACT 3. SC. 2




            PLAYER QUEEN
FTLN 2140     Nor Earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
FTLN 2141     Sport and repose lock from me day and night,                         240
FTLN 2142      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
FTLN 2143      An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope.
FTLN 2144     Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
FTLN 2145     Meet what I would have well and it destroy.
FTLN 2146     Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,                        245
FTLN 2147     If, once a widow, ever I be wife.
FTLN 2148   HAMLET If she should break it now!
            PLAYER KING
FTLN 2149      ’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
FTLN 2150      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
FTLN 2151      The tedious day with sleep.                          Sleeps.        250
FTLN 2152   PLAYER QUEEN                      Sleep rock thy brain,
FTLN 2153      And never come mischance between us twain.
                                                        Player Queen exits.
FTLN 2154   HAMLET Madam, how like you this play?
FTLN 2155   QUEEN The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
FTLN 2156   HAMLET O, but she’ll keep her word.                                    255
FTLN 2157   KING Have you heard the argument? Is there no
FTLN 2158        offense in ’t?
FTLN 2159   HAMLET No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest. No
FTLN 2160        offense i’ th’ world.
FTLN 2161   KING What do you call the play?                                        260
FTLN 2162   HAMLET “The Mousetrap.” Marry, how? Tropically.
FTLN 2163        This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.
FTLN 2164        Gonzago is the duke’s name, his wife Baptista. You
FTLN 2165        shall see anon. ’Tis a knavish piece of work, but
FTLN 2166        what of that? Your Majesty and we that have free                  265
FTLN 2167        souls, it touches us not. Let the galled jade wince;
FTLN 2168        our withers are unwrung.

                                    Enter Lucianus.

FTLN 2169       This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

FTLN 2171   HAMLET     I could interpret between you and your love,              270
FTLN 2172       if I could see the puppets dallying.
FTLN 2173   OPHELIA You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
FTLN 2174   HAMLET It would cost you a groaning to take off mine
FTLN 2175       edge.
FTLN 2176   OPHELIA Still better and worse.                                      275
FTLN 2177   HAMLET So you mis-take your husbands.—Begin,
FTLN 2178       murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces and
FTLN 2179       begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for
FTLN 2180       revenge.

FTLN 2189        name’s Gonzago. The story is extant and written in
FTLN 2190        very choice Italian. You shall see anon how the
FTLN 2191        murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.                       290

FTLN 2202       Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers (if the

FTLN 2204       Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a

FTLN 2207   HAMLET A whole one, I.
FTLN 2208             For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
FTLN 2209               This realm dismantled was
FTLN 2210             Of Jove himself, and now reigns here

FTLN 2212   HORATIO You might have rhymed.
FTLN 2213   HAMLET O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for
FTLN 2214       a thousand pound. Didst perceive?
FTLN 2215   HORATIO Very well, my lord.
FTLN 2216   HAMLET Upon the talk of the poisoning?                                 315

FTLN 2226   GUILDENSTERN The King, sir—                                            325
FTLN 2227   HAMLET Ay, sir, what of him?
FTLN 2228   GUILDENSTERN Is in his retirement marvelous
FTLN 2229       distempered.
FTLN 2230   HAMLET With drink, sir?
FTLN 2231   GUILDENSTERN No, my lord, with choler.                                 330
FTLN 2232   HAMLET Your wisdom should show itself more richer
FTLN 2233       to signify this to the doctor, for for me to put him to
FTLN 2234       his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more
FTLN 2235       choler.

FTLN 2236   GUILDENSTERN      Good my lord, put your discourse into             335
FTLN 2237       some frame and start not so wildly from my
FTLN 2238       affair.
FTLN 2239   HAMLET I am tame, sir. Pronounce.
FTLN 2240   GUILDENSTERN The Queen your mother, in most great
FTLN 2241       affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.                      340
FTLN 2242   HAMLET You are welcome.
FTLN 2243   GUILDENSTERN Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not
FTLN 2244       of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me
FTLN 2245       a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s
FTLN 2246       commandment. If not, your pardon and my return                  345
FTLN 2247       shall be the end of my business.
FTLN 2248   HAMLET Sir, I cannot.
FTLN 2249   ROSENCRANTZ What, my lord?
FTLN 2250   HAMLET Make you a wholesome answer. My wit’s
FTLN 2251       diseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you              350
FTLN 2252       shall command—or, rather, as you say, my mother.
FTLN 2253       Therefore no more but to the matter. My mother,
FTLN 2254       you say—
FTLN 2255   ROSENCRANTZ Then thus she says: your behavior hath
FTLN 2256       struck her into amazement and admiration.                       355
FTLN 2257   HAMLET O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother!
FTLN 2258       But is there no sequel at the heels of this
FTLN 2259       mother’s admiration? Impart.
FTLN 2260   ROSENCRANTZ She desires to speak with you in her
FTLN 2261       closet ere you go to bed.                                       360
FTLN 2262   HAMLET We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
FTLN 2263       Have you any further trade with us?
FTLN 2264   ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you once did love me.
FTLN 2265   HAMLET And do still, by these pickers and stealers.
FTLN 2266   ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord, what is your cause of                     365
FTLN 2267       distemper? You do surely bar the door upon your
FTLN 2268       own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.
FTLN 2269   HAMLET Sir, I lack advancement.
FTLN 2270   ROSENCRANTZ How can that be, when you have the
FTLN 2271       voice of the King himself for your succession in                370

FTLN 2273   HAMLET   Ay, sir, but “While the grass grows”—the

                          Enter the Players with recorders.

FTLN 2275       O, the recorders! Let me see one. He takes a

FTLN 2277       with you: why do you go about to recover the wind
FTLN 2278       of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?
FTLN 2279   GUILDENSTERN O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my
FTLN 2280       love is too unmannerly.
FTLN 2281   HAMLET I do not well understand that. Will you play                 380
FTLN 2282       upon this pipe?

FTLN 2287   GUILDENSTERN I know no touch of it, my lord.
FTLN 2288   HAMLET It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages
FTLN 2289       with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with
FTLN 2290       your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent
FTLN 2291       music. Look you, these are the stops.                           390
FTLN 2292   GUILDENSTERN But these cannot I command to any
FTLN 2293       utt’rance of harmony. I have not the skill.
FTLN 2294   HAMLET Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing
FTLN 2295       you make of me! You would play upon me, you
FTLN 2296       would seem to know my stops, you would pluck                    395
FTLN 2297       out the heart of my mystery, you would sound me
FTLN 2298       from my lowest note to the top of my compass;

FTLN 2302       Call me what instrument you will, though you can
FTLN 2303       fret me, you cannot play upon me.

FTLN 2305   POLONIUS     My lord, the Queen would speak with you,
FTLN 2306        and presently.                                                   405
FTLN 2307   HAMLET Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in
FTLN 2308        shape of a camel?
FTLN 2309   POLONIUS By th’ Mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
FTLN 2310   HAMLET Methinks it is like a weasel.
FTLN 2311   POLONIUS It is backed like a weasel.                                  410
FTLN 2312   HAMLET Or like a whale.
FTLN 2313   POLONIUS Very like a whale.
FTLN 2314    HAMLET      Then I will come to my mother by and by.
FTLN 2315          Aside. They fool me to the top of my bent.—I will
FTLN 2316        come by and by.                                                  415
FTLN 2317    POLONIUS      I will say so.
FTLN 2318    HAMLET      “By and by” is easily said. Leave me,
FTLN 2319        friends.
                                                       All but Hamlet exit.

FTLN 2323      Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot
FTLN 2324        blood
FTLN 2325      And do such bitter business as the day
FTLN 2326      Would quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.                    425
FTLN 2327      O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
FTLN 2328      The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
FTLN 2329      Let me be cruel, not unnatural.
FTLN 2330      I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
FTLN 2331      My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:                          430

            KING
FTLN 2334     I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
FTLN 2335     To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.
FTLN 2336     I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
FTLN 2337     And he to England shall along with you.
FTLN 2338     The terms of our estate may not endure                             5
FTLN 2339     Hazard so near ’s as doth hourly grow
FTLN 2340     Out of his brows.
FTLN 2341   GUILDENSTERN           We will ourselves provide.
FTLN 2342     Most holy and religious fear it is
FTLN 2343     To keep those many many bodies safe                                10
FTLN 2344     That live and feed upon your Majesty.
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 2345     The single and peculiar life is bound
FTLN 2346     With all the strength and armor of the mind
FTLN 2347     To keep itself from noyance, but much more
FTLN 2348     That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests                      15
FTLN 2349     The lives of many. The cess of majesty
FTLN 2350     Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
FTLN 2351     What’s near it with it; or it is a massy wheel
FTLN 2352     Fixed on the summit of the highest mount,
FTLN 2353     To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things                    20
FTLN 2354     Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,
FTLN 2355     Each small annexment, petty consequence,
FTLN 2356     Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone
FTLN 2357     Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

            POLONIUS
FTLN 2362      My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.
FTLN 2363      Behind the arras I’ll convey myself                                 30
FTLN 2364      To hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him
FTLN 2365         home;
FTLN 2366      And, as you said (and wisely was it said),
FTLN 2367      ’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
FTLN 2368      Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear                    35
FTLN 2369      The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
FTLN 2370      I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed
FTLN 2371      And tell you what I know.
FTLN 2372   KING                             Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                             Polonius exits.
FTLN 2373      O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;                         40
FTLN 2374      It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t,
FTLN 2375      A brother’s murder. Pray can I not,
FTLN 2376      Though inclination be as sharp as will.
FTLN 2377      My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
FTLN 2378      And, like a man to double business bound,                           45
FTLN 2379      I stand in pause where I shall first begin
FTLN 2380      And both neglect. What if this cursèd hand
FTLN 2381      Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood?
FTLN 2382      Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
FTLN 2383      To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy                      50
FTLN 2384      But to confront the visage of offense?
FTLN 2385      And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,
FTLN 2386      To be forestallèd ere we come to fall,
FTLN 2387      Or pardoned being down? Then I’ll look up.
FTLN 2388      My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer                       55
FTLN 2389      Can serve my turn? “Forgive me my foul murder”?
FTLN 2390      That cannot be, since I am still possessed
FTLN 2391      Of those effects for which I did the murder:
FTLN 2392      My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
FTLN 2393      May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense?                         60
FTLN 2394      In the corrupted currents of this world,
FTLN 2395      Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice,

FTLN 2396     And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself
FTLN 2397     Buys out the law. But ’tis not so above:
FTLN 2398     There is no shuffling; there the action lies                        65
FTLN 2399     In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,
FTLN 2400     Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
FTLN 2401     To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
FTLN 2402     Try what repentance can. What can it not?
FTLN 2403     Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?                            70
FTLN 2404     O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
FTLN 2405     O limèd soul, that, struggling to be free,
FTLN 2406     Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay.
FTLN 2407     Bow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel
FTLN 2408     Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe.                              75

FTLN 2412                            And so he goes to heaven,
FTLN 2413     And so am I revenged. That would be scanned:                        80
FTLN 2414     A villain kills my father, and for that,
FTLN 2415     I, his sole son, do this same villain send
FTLN 2416     To heaven.
FTLN 2417     Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
FTLN 2418     He took my father grossly, full of bread,                           85
FTLN 2419     With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
FTLN 2420     And how his audit stands who knows save heaven.
FTLN 2421     But in our circumstance and course of thought
FTLN 2422     ’Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged

FTLN 2424     When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
FTLN 2425     No.

FTLN 2496     Is thought-sick at the act.                                        60
FTLN 2497   QUEEN                          Ay me, what act
FTLN 2498     That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
            HAMLET
FTLN 2499     Look here upon this picture and on this,
FTLN 2500     The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
FTLN 2501     See what a grace was seated on this brow,                          65
FTLN 2502     Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,
FTLN 2503     An eye like Mars’ to threaten and command,
FTLN 2504     A station like the herald Mercury
FTLN 2505     New-lighted on a heaven -kissing hill,
             175                    Hamlet                     ACT 3. SC. 4




FTLN 2506     A combination and a form indeed                                 70
FTLN 2507     Where every god did seem to set his seal
FTLN 2508     To give the world assurance of a man.
FTLN 2509     This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
FTLN 2510     Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear
FTLN 2511     Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?                  75
FTLN 2512     Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
FTLN 2513     And batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes?
FTLN 2514     You cannot call it love, for at your age
FTLN 2515     The heyday in the blood is tame, it’s humble
FTLN 2516     And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment                  80
FTLN 2517     Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
FTLN 2518     Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
FTLN 2519     Is apoplexed; for madness would not err,
FTLN 2520     Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thralled,
FTLN 2521     But it reserved some quantity of choice                         85
FTLN 2522     To serve in such a difference. What devil was ’t
FTLN 2523     That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?
FTLN 2524      Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
FTLN 2525     Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
FTLN 2526     Or but a sickly part of one true sense                          90
FTLN 2527     Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?
FTLN 2528     Rebellious hell,
FTLN 2529     If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,
FTLN 2530     To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
FTLN 2531     And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame                     95
FTLN 2532     When the compulsive ardor gives the charge,
FTLN 2533     Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
FTLN 2534     And reason panders will.
FTLN 2535   QUEEN O Hamlet, speak no more!
FTLN 2536     Thou turn’st my eyes into my very soul,                         100
FTLN 2537     And there I see such black and grainèd spots
FTLN 2538     As will not leave their tinct.
FTLN 2539   HAMLET                               Nay, but to live
FTLN 2540     In the rank sweat of an enseamèd bed,
FTLN 2541     Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love                  105

FTLN 2543   QUEEN    O, speak to me no more!
FTLN 2544     These words like daggers enter in my ears.
FTLN 2545     No more, sweet Hamlet!
FTLN 2546   HAMLET                        A murderer and a villain,               110
FTLN 2547     A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
FTLN 2548     Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings,
FTLN 2549     A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
FTLN 2550     That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
FTLN 2551     And put it in his pocket—                                           115
FTLN 2552   QUEEN No more!

FTLN 2554     Save me and hover o’er me with your wings,
FTLN 2555     You heavenly guards!—What would your gracious
FTLN 2556       figure?                                                           120
FTLN 2557   QUEEN Alas, he’s mad.
            HAMLET
FTLN 2558     Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
FTLN 2559     That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
FTLN 2560     Th’ important acting of your dread command?
FTLN 2561     O, say!                                                             125
FTLN 2562   GHOST       Do not forget. This visitation
FTLN 2563     Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
FTLN 2564     But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
FTLN 2565     O, step between her and her fighting soul.
FTLN 2566     Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.                          130
FTLN 2567     Speak to her, Hamlet.
FTLN 2568   HAMLET                     How is it with you, lady?
FTLN 2569   QUEEN Alas, how is ’t with you,
FTLN 2570     That you do bend your eye on vacancy
FTLN 2571     And with th’ incorporal air do hold discourse?                      135
FTLN 2572     Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,
FTLN 2573     And, as the sleeping soldiers in th’ alarm,
FTLN 2574     Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
FTLN 2575     Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,

FTLN 2576      Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper                           140
FTLN 2577      Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
            HAMLET
FTLN 2578     On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares.
FTLN 2579     His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,
FTLN 2580     Would make them capable. To the Ghost. Do not
FTLN 2581       look upon me,                                                     145
FTLN 2582     Lest with this piteous action you convert
FTLN 2583     My stern effects. Then what I have to do
FTLN 2584     Will want true color—tears perchance for blood.
FTLN 2585   QUEEN To whom do you speak this?
FTLN 2586   HAMLET Do you see nothing there?                                      150
            QUEEN
FTLN 2587     Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
FTLN 2588   HAMLET Nor did you nothing hear?
FTLN 2589   QUEEN No, nothing but ourselves.
            HAMLET
FTLN 2590      Why, look you there, look how it steals away!
FTLN 2591      My father, in his habit as he lived!                               155

FTLN 2593     This is the very coinage of your brain.
FTLN 2594     This bodiless creation ecstasy
FTLN 2595     Is very cunning in.

FTLN 2597     My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
FTLN 2598     And makes as healthful music. It is not madness

FTLN 2600     And I the matter will reword, which madness
FTLN 2601     Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,                       165
FTLN 2602     Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
FTLN 2603     That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
FTLN 2604     It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
FTLN 2605     Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
FTLN 2606     Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,                         170

FTLN 2607     Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come,
FTLN 2608     And do not spread the compost on the weeds
FTLN 2609     To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,
FTLN 2610     For, in the fatness of these pursy times,
FTLN 2611     Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,                              175

FTLN 2613     O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!
            HAMLET
FTLN 2614     O, throw away the worser part of it,
FTLN 2615     And live the purer with the other half!
FTLN 2616     Good night. But go not to my uncle’s bed.                           180
FTLN 2617     Assume a virtue if you have it not.
FTLN 2618      That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,

FTLN 2621     He likewise gives a frock or livery                                 185
FTLN 2622     That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,
FTLN 2623     And that shall lend a kind of easiness
FTLN 2624     To the next abstinence, the next more easy;
FTLN 2625     For use almost can change the stamp of nature

FTLN 2627     With wondrous potency. Once more, good night,
FTLN 2628     And, when you are desirous to be blest,
FTLN 2629     I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord

            HAMLET
FTLN 2639     Not this by no means that I bid you do:

FTLN 2641     Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,                     205

FTLN 2644     Make you to ravel all this matter out
FTLN 2645     That I essentially am not in madness,
FTLN 2646     But mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know,                     210
FTLN 2647     For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
FTLN 2648     Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
FTLN 2649     Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
FTLN 2650     No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
FTLN 2651     Unpeg the basket on the house’s top,                                215
FTLN 2652     Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,

FTLN 2662     Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged,

FTLN 2667     But I will delve one yard below their mines
FTLN 2668     And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet

            QUEEN
FTLN 2683      Mad as the sea and wind when both contend

FTLN 2685      Behind the arras hearing something stir,
FTLN 2686      Whips out his rapier, cries “A rat, a rat,”               10
FTLN 2687      And in this brainish apprehension kills

FTLN 2715     Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends

FTLN 2717     And what’s untimely done. …
FTLN 2718      Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,
FTLN 2719     As level as the cannon to his blank
FTLN 2720     Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name
FTLN 2721     And hit the woundless air. O, come away!                          45
FTLN 2722     My soul is full of discord and dismay.

FTLN 2723   HAMLET   Safely stowed.
FTLN 2724    GENTLEMEN , within Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
FTLN 2725   HAMLET But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?
FTLN 2726       O, here they come.

                     Enter Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.

            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 2727     What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?                    5
            HAMLET
FTLN 2728      Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin.
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 2729     Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence
FTLN 2730     And bear it to the chapel.
FTLN 2731   HAMLET Do not believe it.
FTLN 2732   ROSENCRANTZ Believe what?                                             10
FTLN 2733   HAMLET That I can keep your counsel and not mine
FTLN 2734       own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what
FTLN 2735       replication should be made by the son of a king?
FTLN 2736   ROSENCRANTZ Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
FTLN 2737   HAMLET Ay, sir, that soaks up the King’s countenance,                 15
FTLN 2738       his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
FTLN 2739       King best service in the end. He keeps them like an
FTLN 2740       ape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed,
FTLN 2741       to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have
FTLN 2742       gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you                20
FTLN 2743       shall be dry again.
FTLN 2744   ROSENCRANTZ I understand you not, my lord.
FTLN 2745   HAMLET I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a
FTLN 2746       foolish ear.
FTLN 2747   ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you must tell us where the                       25
FTLN 2748       body is and go with us to the King.
FTLN 2749   HAMLET The body is with the King, but the King is not
FTLN 2750       with the body. The King is a thing—

FTLN 2751   GUILDENSTERN  A “thing,” my lord?
FTLN 2752   HAMLET Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and                    30
FTLN 2753      all after!

            KING
FTLN 2754     I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
FTLN 2755     How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
FTLN 2756     Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
FTLN 2757     He’s loved of the distracted multitude,
FTLN 2758     Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;                    5
FTLN 2759     And, where ’tis so, th’ offender’s scourge is weighed,
FTLN 2760     But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,
FTLN 2761     This sudden sending him away must seem
FTLN 2762     Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
FTLN 2763     By desperate appliance are relieved                                10
FTLN 2764     Or not at all.

                                 Enter Rosencrantz.

FTLN 2765                   How now, what hath befallen?
            ROSENCRANTZ
FTLN 2766      Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,
FTLN 2767      We cannot get from him.
FTLN 2768   KING                         But where is he?                        15

                             They enter with Hamlet.

FTLN 2772   KING  Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius?
FTLN 2773   HAMLET At supper.                                                    20

FTLN 2774   KING    At supper where?
FTLN 2775   HAMLET Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A
FTLN 2776        certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at
FTLN 2777        him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We
FTLN 2778        fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves              25
FTLN 2779        for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is
FTLN 2780        but variable service—two dishes but to one table.
FTLN 2781        That’s the end.
FTLN 2782    KING Alas, alas!
FTLN 2783   HAMLET A man may fish with the worm that hath eat                        30
FTLN 2784        of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that
FTLN 2785        worm.
FTLN 2786   KING What dost thou mean by this?
FTLN 2787   HAMLET Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
FTLN 2788        progress through the guts of a beggar.                              35
FTLN 2789   KING Where is Polonius?
FTLN 2790   HAMLET In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger
FTLN 2791        find him not there, seek him i’ th’ other
FTLN 2792        place yourself. But if, indeed, you find him not
FTLN 2793        within this month, you shall nose him as you go up                  40
FTLN 2794        the stairs into the lobby.
FTLN 2795   KING , to Attendants.      Go, seek him there.
FTLN 2796   HAMLET He will stay till you come.               Attendants exit.
            KING
FTLN 2797      Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety
FTLN 2798      (Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve                              45
FTLN 2799      For that which thou hast done) must send thee

FTLN 2822     Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red

FTLN 2825     Our sovereign process, which imports at full,

FTLN 2827     The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England,

FTLN 2846     Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,

FTLN 2848     Truly to speak, and with no addition,
FTLN 2849     We go to gain a little patch of ground

FTLN 2931     Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

FTLN 2935              At his head a grass-green turf,

FTLN 2971   KING How long hath she been thus?
FTLN 2972   OPHELIA I hope all will be well. We must be patient,
FTLN 2973         but I cannot choose but weep to think they would
FTLN 2974         lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of               75

FTLN 2986      Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and

FTLN 2988      For good Polonius’ death, and we have done but

FTLN 3000      In ear and ear. O, my dear Gertrude, this,
FTLN 3001      Like to a murd’ring piece, in many places
FTLN 3002      Gives me superfluous death.
                                                            A noise within.

FTLN 3035      That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—
FTLN 3036      Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.

FTLN 3125      Laertes, I must commune with your grief,

FTLN 3130      They find us touched, we will our kingdom give,
FTLN 3131      Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
FTLN 3132      To you in satisfaction; but if not,
FTLN 3133      Be you content to lend your patience to us,
FTLN 3134      And we shall jointly labor with your soul                          235

FTLN 3145   HORATIO    What are they that would speak with me?
FTLN 3146   GENTLEMAN Seafaring men, sir. They say they have

FTLN 3148   HORATIO Let them come in. Gentleman exits. I do not

FTLN 3151   SAILOR    God bless you, sir.
FTLN 3152   HORATIO Let Him bless thee too.
FTLN 3153   SAILOR He shall, sir, an ’t please Him. There’s a letter
FTLN 3154        for you, sir. It came from th’ ambassador that was              10
FTLN 3155        bound for England—if your name be Horatio, as I
FTLN 3156        am let to know it is.          He hands Horatio a letter.
FTLN 3157   HORATIO reads the letter      Horatio, when thou shalt have
FTLN 3158        overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the
FTLN 3159        King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days           15
FTLN 3160        old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave
FTLN 3161        us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
FTLN 3162        a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.
FTLN 3163        On the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alone
FTLN 3164        became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like             20
FTLN 3165        thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to
FTLN 3166        do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters
FTLN 3167        I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed
FTLN 3168        as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in
FTLN 3169        thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too            25
FTLN 3170        light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows
FTLN 3171        will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

            KING
FTLN 3179      Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
FTLN 3180      And you must put me in your heart for friend,
FTLN 3181      Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
FTLN 3182      That he which hath your noble father slain
FTLN 3183      Pursued my life.                                                   5
FTLN 3184   LAERTES                It well appears. But tell me
FTLN 3185      Why you proceeded not against these feats,
FTLN 3186      So criminal and so capital in nature,
FTLN 3187      As by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else,
FTLN 3188      You mainly were stirred up.                                        10
FTLN 3189   KING O, for two special reasons,
FTLN 3190      Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,
FTLN 3191      But yet to me they’re strong. The Queen his mother
FTLN 3192      Lives almost by his looks, and for myself
FTLN 3193      (My virtue or my plague, be it either which),                      15
FTLN 3194      She is so conjunctive to my life and soul
FTLN 3195      That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
FTLN 3196      I could not but by her. The other motive
FTLN 3197      Why to a public count I might not go
FTLN 3198      Is the great love the general gender bear him,                     20
FTLN 3199      Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
FTLN 3200      Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
FTLN 3201      Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,
FTLN 3202      Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,
FTLN 3203      Would have reverted to my bow again,                               25
FTLN 3204      But not where I have aimed them.
            LAERTES

FTLN 3206     A sister driven into desp’rate terms,
FTLN 3207     Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
FTLN 3208     Stood challenger on mount of all the age                            30
FTLN 3209     For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
            KING
FTLN 3210     Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
FTLN 3211     That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
FTLN 3212     That we can let our beard be shook with danger
FTLN 3213     And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.                  35
FTLN 3214     I loved your father, and we love ourself,
FTLN 3215     And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—

            MESSENGER
FTLN 3221      Sailors, my lord, they say. I saw them not.
FTLN 3222      They were given me by Claudio. He received them

FTLN 3227          Reads. High and mighty, you shall know I am set

FTLN 3230        pardon) thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden

FTLN 3232      What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
FTLN 3233      Or is it some abuse and no such thing?                             55

FTLN 3250      To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
FTLN 3251      Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
FTLN 3252      And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,

FTLN 3259      You have been talked of since your travel much,
FTLN 3260      And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality
FTLN 3261      Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts
FTLN 3262      Did not together pluck such envy from him
FTLN 3263      As did that one, and that, in my regard,                           85

FTLN 3271      Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
FTLN 3272      I have seen myself, and served against, the French,
FTLN 3273      And they can well on horseback, but this gallant                 95

FTLN 3276      As had he been encorpsed and demi-natured
FTLN 3277      With the brave beast. So far he topped my thought

FTLN 3290      That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed

            KING
FTLN 3304     Not that I think you did not love your father,
FTLN 3305     But that I know love is begun by time
FTLN 3306     And that I see, in passages of proof,
FTLN 3307     Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
FTLN 3308      There lives within the very flame of love                           130
FTLN 3309     A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,
FTLN 3310     And nothing is at a like goodness still;
FTLN 3311     For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,
FTLN 3312     Dies in his own too-much. That we would do
FTLN 3313     We should do when we would; for this “would”                         135
FTLN 3314       changes
FTLN 3315     And hath abatements and delays as many
FTLN 3316     As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
FTLN 3317     And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh,
FTLN 3318     That hurts by easing. But to the quick of th’ ulcer:                 140
FTLN 3319     Hamlet comes back; what would you undertake
FTLN 3320     To show yourself indeed your father’s son
FTLN 3321     More than in words?

FTLN 3325     Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
FTLN 3326     Hamlet, returned, shall know you are come home.
FTLN 3327     We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence

FTLN 3329     The Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine,
FTLN 3330       together
FTLN 3331     And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
FTLN 3332     Most generous, and free from all contriving,
FTLN 3333     Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,                        155

FTLN 3337   LAERTES                               I will do ’t,
FTLN 3338      And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.                           160
FTLN 3339      I bought an unction of a mountebank
FTLN 3340      So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
FTLN 3341      Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
FTLN 3342      Collected from all simples that have virtue
FTLN 3343      Under the moon, can save the thing from death                        165
FTLN 3344      That is but scratched withal. I’ll touch my point
FTLN 3345      With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
FTLN 3346      It may be death.
FTLN 3347   KING                    Let’s further think of this,
FTLN 3348      Weigh what convenience both of time and means                        170
FTLN 3349      May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,
FTLN 3350      And that our drift look through our bad
FTLN 3351         performance,
FTLN 3352      ’Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project
FTLN 3353      Should have a back or second that might hold                         175
FTLN 3354      If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.
FTLN 3355      We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings—
FTLN 3356      I ha ’t!
FTLN 3357      When in your motion you are hot and dry
FTLN 3358      (As make your bouts more violent to that end)                        180
FTLN 3359      And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared
FTLN 3360         him
FTLN 3361      A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
FTLN 3362      If he by chance escape your venomed stuck,
FTLN 3363      Our purpose may hold there.—But stay, what                           185
FTLN 3364         noise?

                                     Enter Queen.

            QUEEN
FTLN 3365     One woe doth tread upon another’s heel,
FTLN 3366     So fast they follow. Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.
FTLN 3367   LAERTES Drowned? O, where?
            QUEEN
FTLN 3368     There is a willow grows askant the brook                              190

FTLN 3369     That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
FTLN 3370     Therewith fantastic garlands did she make
FTLN 3371     Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
FTLN 3372     That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
FTLN 3373     But our cold maids do “dead men’s fingers” call                       195
FTLN 3374       them.
FTLN 3375     There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
FTLN 3376     Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
FTLN 3377     When down her weedy trophies and herself
FTLN 3378     Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,                   200
FTLN 3379     And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,
FTLN 3380     Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds,
FTLN 3381     As one incapable of her own distress
FTLN 3382     Or like a creature native and endued
FTLN 3383     Unto that element. But long it could not be                           205
FTLN 3384     Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
FTLN 3385     Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay
FTLN 3386     To muddy death.
FTLN 3387   LAERTES               Alas, then she is drowned.
FTLN 3388   QUEEN Drowned, drowned.                                                 210
            LAERTES
FTLN 3389      Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
FTLN 3390      And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet
FTLN 3391      It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
FTLN 3392      Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
FTLN 3393      The woman will be out.—Adieu, my lord.                               215
FTLN 3394      I have a speech o’ fire that fain would blaze,
FTLN 3395      But that this folly drowns it.                       He exits.

FTLN 3397      How much I had to do to calm his rage!
FTLN 3398      Now fear I this will give it start again.                            220

                          Enter Gravedigger and Another.

FTLN 3400    GRAVEDIGGER        Is she to be buried in Christian burial,
FTLN 3401       when she willfully seeks her own salvation?
FTLN 3402   OTHER I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave
FTLN 3403       straight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it
FTLN 3404       Christian burial.                                          5
FTLN 3405    GRAVEDIGGER        How can that be, unless she drowned
FTLN 3406       herself in her own defense?
FTLN 3407   OTHER Why, ’tis found so.
FTLN 3408    GRAVEDIGGER        It must be se offendendo; it cannot be
FTLN 3409       else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself           10
FTLN 3410       wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three
FTLN 3411       branches—it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she
FTLN 3412       drowned herself wittingly.
FTLN 3413   OTHER Nay, but hear you, goodman delver—
FTLN 3414    GRAVEDIGGER        Give me leave. Here lies the water;        15
FTLN 3415       good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to
FTLN 3416       this water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he)
FTLN 3417       he goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him
FTLN 3418       and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he
FTLN 3419       that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his       20
FTLN 3420       own life.
FTLN 3421   OTHER But is this law?
FTLN 3422    GRAVEDIGGER        Ay, marry, is ’t—crowner’s ’quest law.

FTLN 3423   OTHER    Will you ha’ the truth on ’t? If this had not been
FTLN 3424       a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’                   25
FTLN 3425       Christian burial.
FTLN 3426    GRAVEDIGGER       Why, there thou sayst. And the more
FTLN 3427       pity that great folk should have count’nance in this
FTLN 3428       world to drown or hang themselves more than
FTLN 3429       their even-Christian. Come, my spade. There is no                   30
FTLN 3430       ancient gentlemen but gard’ners, ditchers, and
FTLN 3431       grave-makers. They hold up Adam’s profession.
FTLN 3432   OTHER Was he a gentleman?
FTLN 3433    GRAVEDIGGER       He was the first that ever bore arms.
FTLN 3434    OTHER Why, he had none.                                                35
FTLN 3435    GRAVEDIGGER       What, art a heathen? How dost thou
FTLN 3436       understand the scripture? The scripture says Adam
FTLN 3437       digged. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another
FTLN 3438       question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
FTLN 3439       purpose, confess thyself—                                           40
FTLN 3440   OTHER Go to!
FTLN 3441    GRAVEDIGGER       What is he that builds stronger than
FTLN 3442       either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
FTLN 3443   OTHER The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
FTLN 3444       thousand tenants.                                                   45
FTLN 3445    GRAVEDIGGER       I like thy wit well, in good faith. The
FTLN 3446       gallows does well. But how does it well? It does
FTLN 3447       well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the
FTLN 3448       gallows is built stronger than the church. Argal, the
FTLN 3449       gallows may do well to thee. To ’t again, come.                     50
FTLN 3450   OTHER “Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,
FTLN 3451       or a carpenter?”
FTLN 3452    GRAVEDIGGER       Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
FTLN 3453   OTHER Marry, now I can tell.
FTLN 3454    GRAVEDIGGER       To ’t.                                               55
FTLN 3455   OTHER Mass, I cannot tell.


                          Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

FTLN 3456    GRAVEDIGGER       Cudgel thy brains no more about it,

FTLN 3457       for your dull ass will not mend his pace with
FTLN 3458       beating. And, when you are asked this question
FTLN 3459       next, say “a grave-maker.” The houses he makes                   60
FTLN 3460       lasts till doomsday. Go, get thee in, and fetch me a

FTLN 3462      In youth when I did love, did love,

FTLN 3465        O, methought there—a—was nothing—a—meet.
FTLN 3466   HAMLET Has this fellow no feeling of his business? He
FTLN 3467       sings in grave-making.
FTLN 3468   HORATIO Custom hath made it in him a property of
FTLN 3469       easiness.                                                        70
FTLN 3470   HAMLET ’Tis e’en so. The hand of little employment
FTLN 3471       hath the daintier sense.
             GRAVEDIGGER sings
FTLN 3472               But age with his stealing steps
FTLN 3473               Hath clawed me in his clutch,
FTLN 3474               And hath shipped me into the land,                       75
FTLN 3475               As if I had never been such.
                                                       He digs up a skull.
FTLN 3476   HAMLET That skull had a tongue in it and could sing
FTLN 3477       once. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if
FTLN 3478       ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder!
FTLN 3479       This might be the pate of a politician which this ass            80
FTLN 3480       now o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God,
FTLN 3481       might it not?
FTLN 3482   HORATIO It might, my lord.
FTLN 3483   HAMLET Or of a courtier, which could say “Good
FTLN 3484       morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?”                  85
FTLN 3485       This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my
FTLN 3486       Lord Such-a-one’s horse when he went to beg it,

FTLN 3490        chapless and knocked about the mazard with a
FTLN 3491        sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had
FTLN 3492        the trick to see ’t. Did these bones cost no more the
FTLN 3493        breeding but to play at loggets with them? Mine
FTLN 3494        ache to think on ’t.                                               95

FTLN 3498                  For such a guest is meet.
                                                     He digs up more skulls.
FTLN 3499   HAMLET There’s another. Why may not that be the                         100
FTLN 3500        skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his
FTLN 3501        quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why
FTLN 3502        does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him
FTLN 3503        about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell
FTLN 3504        him of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow might               105
FTLN 3505        be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
FTLN 3506        his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
FTLN 3507        his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the
FTLN 3508        recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full
FTLN 3509        of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more                  110
FTLN 3510        of his purchases, and double ones too, than the
FTLN 3511        length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very
FTLN 3512        conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box,
FTLN 3513        and must th’ inheritor himself have no more, ha?
FTLN 3514   HORATIO Not a jot more, my lord.                                        115
FTLN 3515   HAMLET Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
FTLN 3516   HORATIO Ay, my lord, and of calves’ skins too.
FTLN 3517   HAMLET They are sheep and calves which seek out

FTLN 3523   HAMLET     I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in ’t.

FTLN 3525       not yours. For my part, I do not lie in ’t, yet it is
FTLN 3526       mine.
FTLN 3527   HAMLET Thou dost lie in ’t, to be in ’t and say it is thine.
FTLN 3528       ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou
FTLN 3529       liest.                                                              130

FTLN 3532   HAMLET What man dost thou dig it for?
FTLN 3533    GRAVEDIGGER        For no man, sir.
FTLN 3534   HAMLET What woman then?                                                 135
FTLN 3535    GRAVEDIGGER        For none, neither.

FTLN 3538       her soul, she’s dead.
FTLN 3539   HAMLET How absolute the knave is! We must speak by                      140
FTLN 3540       the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the
FTLN 3541       Lord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of
FTLN 3542       it: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
FTLN 3543       peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
FTLN 3544       galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been                             145
FTLN 3545       grave-maker?
FTLN 3546    GRAVEDIGGER        Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to ’t
FTLN 3547       that day that our last King Hamlet overcame
FTLN 3548       Fortinbras.
FTLN 3549   HAMLET How long is that since?                                          150
FTLN 3550    GRAVEDIGGER        Cannot you tell that? Every fool can
FTLN 3551       tell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet
FTLN 3552       was born—he that is mad, and sent into England.
FTLN 3553   HAMLET Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
FTLN 3554    GRAVEDIGGER        Why, because he was mad. He shall                   155
FTLN 3555       recover his wits there. Or if he do not, ’tis no great
FTLN 3556       matter there.
FTLN 3557   HAMLET Why?
FTLN 3558    GRAVEDIGGER        ’Twill not be seen in him there. There
FTLN 3559       the men are as mad as he.                                           160

FTLN 3560   HAMLET     How came he mad?
FTLN 3561    GRAVEDIGGER       Very strangely, they say.
FTLN 3562   HAMLET How “strangely”?
FTLN 3563    GRAVEDIGGER       Faith, e’en with losing his wits.
FTLN 3564   HAMLET Upon what ground?                                              165
FTLN 3565    GRAVEDIGGER       Why, here in Denmark. I have been
FTLN 3566       sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.
FTLN 3567   HAMLET How long will a man lie i’ th’ earth ere he rot?
FTLN 3568    GRAVEDIGGER       Faith, if he be not rotten before he die
FTLN 3569       (as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will                  170
FTLN 3570       scarce hold the laying in), he will last you some
FTLN 3571       eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine
FTLN 3572       year.
FTLN 3573   HAMLET Why he more than another?
FTLN 3574    GRAVEDIGGER       Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his           175
FTLN 3575       trade that he will keep out water a great while; and
FTLN 3576       your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead
FTLN 3577       body. Here’s a skull now hath lien you i’ th’ earth
FTLN 3578       three-and-twenty years.
FTLN 3579   HAMLET Whose was it?                                                  180
FTLN 3580    GRAVEDIGGER       A whoreson mad fellow’s it was.
FTLN 3581       Whose do you think it was?
FTLN 3582   HAMLET Nay, I know not.
FTLN 3583    GRAVEDIGGER       A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!
FTLN 3584       He poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.                    185
FTLN 3585       This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick’s skull, the
FTLN 3586       King’s jester.
FTLN 3587   HAMLET This?
FTLN 3588    GRAVEDIGGER       E’en that.
FTLN 3589   HAMLET , taking the skull       Let me see. Alas, poor                190
FTLN 3590       Yorick! I knew him, Horatio—a fellow of infinite
FTLN 3591       jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his
FTLN 3592       back a thousand times, and now how abhorred in
FTLN 3593       my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung
FTLN 3594       those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.                 195

FTLN 3596       songs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to
FTLN 3597       set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your
FTLN 3598       own grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my
FTLN 3599       lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch              200
FTLN 3600       thick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh
FTLN 3601       at that.—Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.
FTLN 3602   HORATIO What’s that, my lord?
FTLN 3603   HAMLET Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this
FTLN 3604       fashion i’ th’ earth?                                            205
FTLN 3605   HORATIO E’en so.
FTLN 3606   HAMLET And smelt so? Pah!              He puts the skull down.
FTLN 3607   HORATIO E’en so, my lord.
FTLN 3608   HAMLET To what base uses we may return, Horatio!
FTLN 3609       Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of                  210
FTLN 3610       Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?
FTLN 3611   HORATIO ’Twere to consider too curiously to consider
FTLN 3612       so.
FTLN 3613   HAMLET No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither,
FTLN 3614       with modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, as                215
FTLN 3615       thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander
FTLN 3616       returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth
FTLN 3617       we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
FTLN 3618       was converted might they not stop a beer barrel?
FTLN 3619     Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,                         220
FTLN 3620     Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
FTLN 3621     O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
FTLN 3622     Should patch a wall t’ expel the winter’s flaw!

                Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords attendant, and the
                   corpse of Ophelia, with a Doctor of Divinity.

FTLN 3623     But soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King,
FTLN 3624     The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?                 225
FTLN 3625     And with such maimèd rites? This doth betoken
FTLN 3626     The corse they follow did with desp’rate hand
FTLN 3627     Fordo its own life. ’Twas of some estate.

            DOCTOR
FTLN 3632     Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
FTLN 3633     As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,
FTLN 3634     And, but that great command o’ersways the order,                     235
FTLN 3635     She should in ground unsanctified been lodged
FTLN 3636     Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers
FTLN 3637      Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on
FTLN 3638       her.
FTLN 3639     Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants,                           240

FTLN 3641     Of bell and burial.
            LAERTES
FTLN 3642     Must there no more be done?
FTLN 3643   DOCTOR                              No more be done.
FTLN 3644     We should profane the service of the dead                            245

FTLN 3685      Could not with all their quantity of love
FTLN 3686      Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

FTLN 3724     Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—

FTLN 3753     They had begun the play. I sat me down,                             35
FTLN 3754     Devised a new commission, wrote it fair—
FTLN 3755     I once did hold it, as our statists do,
FTLN 3756     A baseness to write fair, and labored much
FTLN 3757     How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
FTLN 3758     It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know                          40
FTLN 3759     Th’ effect of what I wrote?
FTLN 3760   HORATIO                           Ay, good my lord.
            HAMLET
FTLN 3761     An earnest conjuration from the King,
FTLN 3762     As England was his faithful tributary,
FTLN 3763     As love between them like the palm might flourish,                  45
FTLN 3764     As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
FTLN 3765     And stand a comma ’tween their amities,
FTLN 3766     And many suchlike ases of great charge,
FTLN 3767     That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
FTLN 3768     Without debatement further, more or less,                           50
FTLN 3769     He should those bearers put to sudden death,
FTLN 3770     Not shriving time allowed.
FTLN 3771   HORATIO                        How was this sealed?
            HAMLET
FTLN 3772     Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
FTLN 3773     I had my father’s signet in my purse,                               55
FTLN 3774     Which was the model of that Danish seal;
FTLN 3775     Folded the writ up in the form of th’ other,
FTLN 3776      Subscribed it, gave ’t th’ impression, placed it
FTLN 3777        safely,
FTLN 3778     The changeling never known. Now, the next day                       60
FTLN 3779     Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
FTLN 3780     Thou knowest already.
            HORATIO
FTLN 3781     So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.
             263                     Hamlet                        ACT 5. SC. 2




            HAMLET
FTLN 3782      Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
FTLN 3783     They are not near my conscience. Their defeat                       65
FTLN 3784     Does by their own insinuation grow.
FTLN 3785     ’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
FTLN 3786     Between the pass and fell incensèd points
FTLN 3787     Of mighty opposites.
FTLN 3788   HORATIO Why, what a king is this!                                     70
            HAMLET
FTLN 3789     Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon—
FTLN 3790     He that hath killed my king and whored my mother,
FTLN 3791     Popped in between th’ election and my hopes,
FTLN 3792     Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
FTLN 3793     And with such cozenage—is ’t not perfect                            75
FTLN 3794       conscience
FTLN 3795      To quit him with this arm? And is ’t not to be
FTLN 3796       damned
FTLN 3797     To let this canker of our nature come
FTLN 3798     In further evil?                                                    80
            HORATIO
FTLN 3799     It must be shortly known to him from England
FTLN 3800     What is the issue of the business there.
            HAMLET
FTLN 3801     It will be short. The interim’s mine,
FTLN 3802     And a man’s life’s no more than to say “one.”
FTLN 3803     But I am very sorry, good Horatio,                                  85
FTLN 3804     That to Laertes I forgot myself,
FTLN 3805     For by the image of my cause I see
FTLN 3806     The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favors.
FTLN 3807     But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
FTLN 3808     Into a tow’ring passion.                                            90
FTLN 3809   HORATIO                       Peace, who comes here?

                              Enter Osric, a courtier.

FTLN 3810   OSRIC Your Lordship is right welcome back to
FTLN 3811       Denmark.
             265                       Hamlet                       ACT 5. SC. 2




FTLN 3812   HAMLET      I humbly thank you, sir. Aside to Horatio.
FTLN 3813        Dost know this waterfly?                                          95
FTLN 3814   HORATIO , aside to Hamlet        No, my good lord.
FTLN 3815   HAMLET , aside to Horatio        Thy state is the more gracious,
FTLN 3816        for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much
FTLN 3817        land, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his
FTLN 3818        crib shall stand at the king’s mess. ’Tis a chough,               100
FTLN 3819        but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
FTLN 3820   OSRIC Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I
FTLN 3821        should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.
FTLN 3822   HAMLET I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
FTLN 3823        spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: ’tis for the            105
FTLN 3824        head.
FTLN 3825   OSRIC I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.
FTLN 3826   HAMLET No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is
FTLN 3827        northerly.
FTLN 3828   OSRIC It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.                         110
FTLN 3829   HAMLET But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for
FTLN 3830        my complexion.
FTLN 3831   OSRIC Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as
FTLN 3832        ’twere—I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty
FTLN 3833        bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager             115
FTLN 3834        on your head. Sir, this is the matter—
FTLN 3835   HAMLET I beseech you, remember. He motions to
                 Osric to put on his hat.
FTLN 3836   OSRIC Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.
FTLN 3837         Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes—believe
FTLN 3838        me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent                 120
FTLN 3839        differences, of very soft society and great showing.
FTLN 3840        Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
FTLN 3841        calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
FTLN 3842        continent of what part a gentleman would see.
FTLN 3843   HAMLET Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in                     125
FTLN 3844        you, though I know to divide him inventorially
FTLN 3845        would dozy th’ arithmetic of memory, and yet but
FTLN 3846        yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
             267                     Hamlet                     ACT 5. SC. 2




FTLN 3847        verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
FTLN 3848        article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness         130
FTLN 3849        as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his
FTLN 3850        mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,
FTLN 3851        nothing more.
FTLN 3852   OSRIC Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
FTLN 3853   HAMLET The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the                    135
FTLN 3854        gentleman in our more rawer breath?
FTLN 3855   OSRIC Sir?
FTLN 3856   HORATIO Is ’t not possible to understand in another
FTLN 3857        tongue? You will to ’t, sir, really.
FTLN 3858   HAMLET , to Osric       What imports the nomination of             140
FTLN 3859        this gentleman?
FTLN 3860   OSRIC Of Laertes?
FTLN 3861   HORATIO His purse is empty already; all ’s golden words
FTLN 3862        are spent.
FTLN 3863   HAMLET Of him, sir.                                                145
FTLN 3864   OSRIC I know you are not ignorant—
FTLN 3865   HAMLET I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, it
FTLN 3866        would not much approve me. Well, sir?
FTLN 3867   OSRIC You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes
FTLN 3868        is—                                                           150
FTLN 3869    HAMLET I dare not confess that, lest I should compare
FTLN 3870        with him in excellence. But to know a man well
FTLN 3871        were to know himself.
FTLN 3872   OSRIC I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation
FTLN 3873        laid on him by them, in his meed he’s                         155
FTLN 3874        unfellowed.
FTLN 3875   HAMLET What’s his weapon?
FTLN 3876   OSRIC Rapier and dagger.
FTLN 3877   HAMLET That’s two of his weapons. But, well—
FTLN 3878   OSRIC The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary             160
FTLN 3879        horses, against the which he has impawned, as I
FTLN 3880        take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
FTLN 3881        assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the
FTLN 3882        carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
             269                    Hamlet                     ACT 5. SC. 2




FTLN 3883        responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and        165
FTLN 3884        of very liberal conceit.
FTLN 3885   HAMLET What call you the “carriages”?
FTLN 3886    HORATIO I knew you must be edified by the margent
FTLN 3887        ere you had done.
FTLN 3888   OSRIC The carriages, sir, are the hangers.                        170
FTLN 3889   HAMLET The phrase would be more germane to the
FTLN 3890        matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I
FTLN 3891        would it might be “hangers” till then. But on. Six
FTLN 3892        Barbary horses against six French swords, their
FTLN 3893        assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages—              175
FTLN 3894        that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this
FTLN 3895        all “impawned,” as you call it?
FTLN 3896   OSRIC The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen
FTLN 3897        passes between yourself and him, he shall not
FTLN 3898        exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for            180
FTLN 3899        nine, and it would come to immediate trial if your
FTLN 3900        Lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
FTLN 3901   HAMLET How if I answer no?
FTLN 3902   OSRIC I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person
FTLN 3903        in trial.                                                    185
FTLN 3904   HAMLET Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his
FTLN 3905        Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let
FTLN 3906        the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
FTLN 3907        King hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.
FTLN 3908        If not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd         190
FTLN 3909        hits.
FTLN 3910   OSRIC Shall I deliver you e’en so?
FTLN 3911   HAMLET To this effect, sir, after what flourish your
FTLN 3912        nature will.
FTLN 3913   OSRIC I commend my duty to your Lordship.                         195
FTLN 3914   HAMLET Yours. Osric exits. He does well to commend
FTLN 3915        it himself. There are no tongues else for ’s
FTLN 3916        turn.
FTLN 3917   HORATIO This lapwing runs away with the shell on his
FTLN 3918        head.                                                        200
             271                       Hamlet                       ACT 5. SC. 2




FTLN 3919   HAMLET      He did comply, sir, with his dug before he
FTLN 3920        sucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same
FTLN 3921        breed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got
FTLN 3922        the tune of the time, and, out of an habit of
FTLN 3923        encounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries             205
FTLN 3924        them through and through the most fanned
FTLN 3925        and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to
FTLN 3926        their trial, the bubbles are out.

                                      Enter a Lord.

FTLN 3927   LORD   My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by
FTLN 3928       young Osric, who brings back to him that you                       210
FTLN 3929       attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your
FTLN 3930       pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
FTLN 3931       take longer time.
FTLN 3932   HAMLET I am constant to my purposes. They follow
FTLN 3933       the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is                215
FTLN 3934       ready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as
FTLN 3935       now.
FTLN 3936   LORD The King and Queen and all are coming down.
FTLN 3937   HAMLET In happy time.
FTLN 3938   LORD The Queen desires you to use some gentle                          220
FTLN 3939       entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
FTLN 3940   HAMLET She well instructs me.                      Lord exits.
FTLN 3941   HORATIO You will lose, my lord.
FTLN 3942   HAMLET I do not think so. Since he went into France, I
FTLN 3943       have been in continual practice. I shall win at the                225
FTLN 3944       odds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here
FTLN 3945       about my heart. But it is no matter.
FTLN 3946   HORATIO Nay, good my lord—
FTLN 3947   HAMLET It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of
FTLN 3948        gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.                      230
FTLN 3949   HORATIO If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will
FTLN 3950       forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.
FTLN 3951   HAMLET Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a
FTLN 3952       special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be
FTLN 3953        now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be           235
             273                        Hamlet                         ACT 5. SC. 2




FTLN 3954          now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The
FTLN 3955          readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves
FTLN 3956          knows, what is ’t to leave betimes? Let be.

               A table prepared. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officers
                with cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state,
                    foils, daggers, flagons of wine, and Laertes.

            KING
FTLN 3957     Come, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.
                                     He puts Laertes’ hand into Hamlet’s.
            HAMLET , to Laertes
FTLN 3958     Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;                        240
FTLN 3959     But pardon ’t as you are a gentleman. This presence
FTLN 3960        knows,
FTLN 3961     And you must needs have heard, how I am punished
FTLN 3962     With a sore distraction. What I have done
FTLN 3963     That might your nature, honor, and exception                            245
FTLN 3964     Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
FTLN 3965     Was ’t Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.
FTLN 3966     If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,
FTLN 3967     And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,
FTLN 3968     Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.                              250
FTLN 3969     Who does it, then? His madness. If ’t be so,
FTLN 3970     Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged;
FTLN 3971     His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.
FTLN 3972      Sir, in this audience
FTLN 3973     Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil                                 255
FTLN 3974     Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
FTLN 3975     That I have shot my arrow o’er the house
FTLN 3976     And hurt my brother.
FTLN 3977   LAERTES I am satisfied in nature,

FTLN 3979     To my revenge; but in my terms of honor
FTLN 3980     I stand aloof and will no reconcilement

FTLN 3982     I have a voice and precedent of peace

FTLN 3984     I do receive your offered love like love
FTLN 3985     And will not wrong it.
FTLN 3986   HAMLET                     I embrace it freely
FTLN 3987     And will this brothers’ wager frankly play.—
FTLN 3988     Give us the foils. Come on.                                          270
FTLN 3989   LAERTES                            Come, one for me.
            HAMLET
FTLN 3990     I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
FTLN 3991     Your skill shall, like a star i’ th’ darkest night,
FTLN 3992     Stick fiery off indeed.
FTLN 3993   LAERTES                      You mock me, sir.                         275
FTLN 3994   HAMLET No, by this hand.
            KING
FTLN 3995     Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
FTLN 3996     You know the wager?
FTLN 3997   HAMLET                    Very well, my lord.
FTLN 3998     Your Grace has laid the odds o’ th’ weaker side.                     280
            KING
FTLN 3999      I do not fear it; I have seen you both.
FTLN 4000      But, since he is better, we have therefore odds.
            LAERTES
FTLN 4001      This is too heavy. Let me see another.
            HAMLET
FTLN 4002     This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
FTLN 4003   OSRIC Ay, my good lord.                                                285
                                                          Prepare to play.

FTLN 4004      Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.—
FTLN 4005      If Hamlet give the first or second hit
FTLN 4006      Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
FTLN 4007      Let all the battlements their ordnance fire.
FTLN 4008      The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,                     290
FTLN 4009      And in the cup an union shall he throw,
FTLN 4010      Richer than that which four successive kings
FTLN 4011      In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups,

FTLN 4018   LAERTES Come, my lord.                            They play.          300
FTLN 4019   HAMLET One.
FTLN 4020   LAERTES No.
FTLN 4021   HAMLET Judgment!
FTLN 4022   OSRIC A hit, a very palpable hit.
FTLN 4023   LAERTES Well, again.                                                  305

FTLN 4024     Stay, give me drink.—Hamlet, this pearl is thine.
FTLN 4025     Here’s to thy health.
                          He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup.

FTLN 4026                           Give him the cup.
            HAMLET
FTLN 4027     I’ll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.
FTLN 4028     Come. They play. Another hit. What say you?                         310

                                                        She lifts the cup.
FTLN 4034   HAMLET Good madam.
FTLN 4035   KING Gertrude, do not drink.
            QUEEN
FTLN 4036      I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.         She drinks.

FTLN 4042      And yet it is almost against my conscience.
            HAMLET
FTLN 4043      Come, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.                       325
FTLN 4044      I pray you pass with your best violence.
FTLN 4045      I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

FTLN 4062     It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.
FTLN 4063     No med’cine in the world can do thee good.                        345
FTLN 4064     In thee there is not half an hour’s life.
FTLN 4065     The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,

FTLN 4092     I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.

FTLN 4109     I cannot live to hear the news from England.
FTLN 4110     But I do prophesy th’ election lights

FTLN 4120     If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
            FORTINBRAS
FTLN 4121     This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
FTLN 4122     What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
FTLN 4123     That thou so many princes at a shot                                     405
FTLN 4124     So bloodily hast struck?
FTLN 4125   AMBASSADOR                      The sight is dismal,
FTLN 4126     And our affairs from England come too late.
FTLN 4127     The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
FTLN 4128     To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,                               410
FTLN 4129     That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
FTLN 4130     Where should we have our thanks?
FTLN 4131   HORATIO                                     Not from his
FTLN 4132        mouth,
FTLN 4133     Had it th’ ability of life to thank you.                                415
FTLN 4134     He never gave commandment for their death.
FTLN 4135     But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
FTLN 4136     You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
FTLN 4137     Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
FTLN 4138     High on a stage be placed to the view,                                  420
FTLN 4139     And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world
FTLN 4140     How these things came about. So shall you hear
FTLN 4141     Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
FTLN 4142     Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
FTLN 4143     Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,                           425
FTLN 4144     And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
FTLN 4145     Fall’n on th’ inventors’ heads. All this can I
FTLN 4146     Truly deliver.
FTLN 4147   FORTINBRAS          Let us haste to hear it
FTLN 4148     And call the noblest to the audience.                                   430
FTLN 4149     For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
FTLN 4150     I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
FTLN 4151     Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
            HORATIO
FTLN 4152     Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
             287                      Hamlet                      ACT 5. SC. 2




FTLN 4153     And from his mouth whose voice will draw on                        435
FTLN 4154       more.
FTLN 4155     But let this same be presently performed
FTLN 4156     Even while men’s minds are wild, lest more
FTLN 4157       mischance
FTLN 4158     On plots and errors happen.                                        440
FTLN 4159   FORTINBRAS                       Let four captains
FTLN 4160     Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,
FTLN 4161     For he was likely, had he been put on,
FTLN 4162     To have proved most royal; and for his passage,
FTLN 4163     The soldier’s music and the rite of war                            445
FTLN 4164     Speak loudly for him.
FTLN 4165     Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
